Donc, ce tutoriel a pour but de présenter PixelGPT dans son intégralité. Euh, je vais commencer par à peu près toutes les sections du site web, à savoir qu'il y a beaucoup de modèles. Une des premières questions que chaque utilisateur débutant va se poser, c'est pourquoi autant de modèles ? Euh, pourquoi est-ce que c'est regroupé selon ces catégories-là, et cetera ?

En résumé, il faut savoir que c'est un site qui a évolué avec l'arrivée de nouveaux modèles. Donc il y a différents modèles utilisant différentes technologies qui sont arrivés soudainement et il a fallu un peu regrouper chaque modèle dans des catégories. Donc chaque catégorie, principalement, c'est des catégories par catégorie de prix.

Donc des modèles pas très compétents mais suffisamment pour un usage courant sont disponibles gratuitement. C'est les premiers que vous voyez sur le site web, donc Text to Minecraft Item Texture 16 by 16 pixels, et cetera, et cetera.

La catégorie Noobie, c'est essentiellement des modèles gratuits qui sont assez accessibles d'utilisation et qui sont censés permettre essentiellement euh de donner de faire découvrir un peu ce que fait le site web et aussi d'avoir un aperçu, parce que la plupart des gens veulent vraiment un aperçu avant de d'acheter. Et euh l'un des modèles phares, c'est le Text to Minecraft Item Texture 16 by 16. C'est le plus utilisé, mais le plus le problème le plus courant avec les débutants, c'est qu'ils savent absolument pas ce que c'est une image. C'est pour ça, je pense que je vais quand même faire une petite explication de ce que c'est une image. C'est tout bête, hein, mais pour beaucoup d'utilisateurs, ça a l'air d'être vachement ambigu, comment Minecraft fonctionne, comment il utilise les textures, euh et cetera et cetera.

Il y a pas de tutoriel parfait pour un débutant. La vérité, elle est là. C'est quand il y a des lacunes qui sont sévères sur des centaines, des centaines de thématiques, c'est absolument impossible de recouvrir tous les sujets. Donc je vais essayer d'être succin, mais il va falloir aussi suivre attentivement et lire dans l'ordre les sections.

Donc là, la première section en question, c'est qu'est-ce qu'une image ? Une image, essentiellement, c'est une suite de pixels euh en deux dimensions. Donc vous avez des pixels qui sont alignés et particulièrement pour Minecraft, c'est une suite de pixels en 16 par 16. Et comment il fait Minecraft pour afficher un item ? Essentiellement, et ben on a des pixels et on va les étirer sur un axe. Donc là, pour le cas de Minecraft, c'est euh l'axe de la profondeur qu'on va étirer. Donc vous prenez par exemple une une épée, euh vous enlevez l'arrière-plan, hein, parce qu'il y a pas d'arrière-plan pour chaque item sur Minecraft. Et une fois que vous avez enlevé l'arrière-plan, et ben ce qu'il va faire, c'est qu'il va prendre votre item et il va l'étirer. Donc il va l'étirer sur l'axe de la profondeur pour donner un un un espèce une espèce de sensation 3D à l'objet en question.

Voilà, donc ça c'est à peu près comment fonctionne l'item dans Minecraft. Euh quand vous quand vous utilisez des items dans Minecraft, essentiellement vous utilisez des images au format PNG. Donc l'extension de fichier que vous voyez à la fin, c'est .png. Et c'est essentiellement ce format-là qui dicte l'ensemble des textures dans Minecraft. Et c'est ça que vous devez euh euh focaliser pour obtenir une texture qui fonctionne.

Je vais pas rentrer dans le détail des textures packs sur Minecraft, c'est un sujet compliqué où il y a différents formats. Euh Minecraft fait évoluer ce format de façon très courante. Euh il y a beaucoup de changements qui qui s'opèrent en arrière-plan et qui sont difficiles à recouvrir dans un seul tutoriel ici.

Donc ce que je recommande aux débutants, c'est de recouvrir leurs lacunes. Vous essayez de comprendre ce que c'est une image, vous essayez de comprendre comment fonctionne un texture pack, vous essayez de comprendre. Ça sert à rien de s'attendre à ce que ce tutoriel recouvre toutes vos toutes vos lacunes. Ça ne sera pas le cas.

Donc quand on parle de texture Minecraft, euh on parle donc d'une image avec un arrière-plan qui a été retiré. On appelle ça de la transparence. Cette transparence, c'est celle qui va qui va différencier l'item de du reste. Donc la transparence est très important puisque le site web ne génère pas d'images avec un arrière-plan transparent. Vous l'avez peut-être remarqué, il génère une image avec un arrière-plan blanc, de couleur blanche.

Donc il est important de comprendre que ce n'est pas parce que l'arrière-plan de l'item est blanc que le site ne fonctionne pas ou qu'il n'est pas compatible avec Minecraft. Il faut réfléchir 2 secondes et se dire que oui, il est facilement possible de retirer cet arrière-plan de façon algorithmique. Donc on peut retirer avec un logiciel. Dans notre cas, je vous montrerai plus tard dans le tutoriel comment retirer l'arrière-plan, mais c'est quelque chose, c'est une étape très simple qui prend deux clics. Il faut juste comprendre que vous utilisez là des images dont l'arrière-plan est effaçable à tout moment.

Le site web ne génère pas des items incompatibles avec Minecraft, il demande juste une étape supplémentaire pour les rendre compatibles avec Minecraft. Voilà, c'est ça qu'il faut retenir essentiellement, c'est très important.

Donc, comme je l'ai expliqué, une image, elle a une taille, donc 16 par 16 ou 32 par 32. Communément dans Minecraft, c'est 16 par 16, l'ensemble des items, des blocs sur Minecraft sont 16 par 16. Il y a bien sûr des exceptions pour les peintures, par exemple, ou des textures de mobs pour différents euh euh éléments du jeu qui ont ce qu'on appelle une résolution, une densité de pixels 16 par 16. Donc c'est quoi une densité de pixels 16 par 16 ? Essentiellement, vous avez euh un un pixel dans le jeu aura toujours la même taille qu'il soit sur un mob, sur un item ou sur un objet quelconque. Et c'est ça qu'on pourrait appeler ou euh qualifier de densité de pixels dans l'espace. Donc cette densité de pixels, donc en fait, la taille d'un pixel dans le jeu ne varie pas en fonction d'un objet, essentiellement. Quand il varie, on barre essentiellement sur ce qu'on appelle du mixel ou du mix resolution pixel. Et essentiellement, euh mixer des résolutions de pixels, c'est assez mauvais. Beaucoup de joueurs le font, n'y réfléchissent pas quand ils le font, mais pour un joueur un peu plus qu'amateur ou expérimenté, ça va se voir tout de suite. Ça aura un côté assez assez perturbant, incohérent et ça sera pas joli à l'œil. Voilà. Donc évitez ce qu'on appelle le mixel, c'est-à-dire de faire des images en 32 par 32 ou 16 par 16. Assurez-vous que la taille d'un pixel dans le jeu ne varie pas en fonction d'un objet ou d'une interface graphique ou d'autres choses. Il faut que vous vous assuriez que vous soyez cohérent sur l'ensemble de votre résolution de pixels.

Donc là, je dis des choses peut-être évidentes pour l'ensemble des des des artistes pixel art, et cetera. Mais j'ai bien vu par expérience que beaucoup de gens sont complètement perdus quand on parle de ce sujet-là. C'est-à-dire, ils comprennent même pas avec qu'est-ce qu'ils touchent, ils comprennent même pas ce que c'est une image, ils ne comprennent même pas ce que c'est une résolution, ils comprennent même pas ce que c'est une taille d'image, ils ne comprennent même pas ce que c'est une taille de pixel dans le jeu. C'est pour ça que j'essaie d'intégrer d'intégrer ces concepts dans votre tête dès le début. J'insiste en répétant pour essayer de recouvrir...

Donc, ça c'est à peu près pour la partie introduction. Je sais que c'est une introduction longue qui a été euh qui est très euh qui est pas assez succinte, mais l'important c'est de bien l'imprimer dans le cerveau de chacun, comment fonctionnent les images dans Minecraft. Voilà.

Donc, quand on revient sur l'interface, l'interface, je tiens à le dire, le site web a des parties simples à comprendre et des parties plus complexes qui sont parfois compliquées en raison d'un manque de temps de ma part d'intégrer des fonctionnalités pour simplifier les choses. Les choses ne sont pas aussi simples que vous le pensez. Il y a énormément de modèles sur le site, il y a énormément de complexité dans le site et il faut bien intégrer ça lorsque vous utilisez le site. Vous n'utilisez pas un un un un un site web clé en main, c'est-à-dire vous allez pas cliquer et obtenir tout ce que vous voulez d'un seul coup. L'IA, ça ça n'est pas ça. Ce n'est pas, ce n'est pas un "je comble toutes mes lacunes dans tous mes domaines". C'est un système assez complexe qui essaie de recouvrir partiellement ou intégralement des difficultés ou euh d'accélérer votre processus de création dans Minecraft. Il ne s'agit pas de recouvrir absolument toutes vos lacunes jusqu'à vos lacunes de compréhension.

Donc maintenant, je vais partir sur une partie qui est absolument euh fondamentale, c'est la partie prompt. La partie prompt, c'est quoi un prompt ? Un prompt, c'est ce que vous allez saisir dans la partie texte pour générer votre image. Vous voulez générer une épée, vous allez écrire "sword" ou "une épée". S'il vous plaît, privilégiez l'anglais pour les prompts parce que les modèles euh le plus souvent comprennent plus l'anglais qu'une autre langue. Donc s'il vous plaît, ne dites pas le site web est mauvais parce qu'il ne comprend pas votre langue. Essentiellement, privilégiez l'anglais, s'il vous plaît. J'insiste, l'anglais.

Donc, en ce qui concerne une épée, euh par exemple, une épée, c'est ce qu'on appelle un prompt. C'est l'entrée du modèle d'IA. Donc l'intelligence artificielle, c'est pas une intelligence qui comprend absolument tout. C'est pas une intelligence qui va pouvoir faire de façon autonome des recherches sur internet, récupérer des informations, et cetera. On n'en est pas à ce stade-là. C'est une intelligence artificielle qui a un set, qui a une des informations fixes situées dans le temps. Ces informations, elle les a accaparées à travers son entraînement. Maintenant, elle va pouvoir les régurgiter de façon un peu plus créative, c'est-à-dire elle va interpoler à travers ce qu'elle a appris. Euh, et elle va pouvoir produire des résultats qui correspondent à votre demande de la façon la plus fidèle possible. Mais il ne s'agit pas de d'une IA qui va être capable de récupérer des résultats sur internet, d'apprendre des nouveaux concepts ou qui a peut-être tous les concepts de l'internet en tête. Elle va avoir uniquement une partie assez restreinte des concepts de l'internet. Donc essayez d'intégrer ça fondamentalement dans votre compréhension. Il s'agit de comprendre que les modèles ne savent pas tout et qu'ils ne résoudront pas tous vos problèmes. Ils ne sont là que pour que pour accélérer votre processus de création, tout comme tout autre outil. Ça reste un outil fondamentalement, il faut le comprendre. Ça reste un outil, ça ne reste ce n'est pas un objet de compensation de vos lacunes. Je je le répète encore pour la 50e fois, ça ne compense pas vos lacunes. Quelqu'un qui est très mauvais à comprendre ce que c'est une image, à prompter, et cetera, générera des résultats bidons et dégueulasses tout simplement parce qu'il ne comprend pas ce qu'il fait et parce que sa bêtise ne compensera pas ses lacunes en termes de compétences. Voilà.

Donc lorsqu'il s'agit de la génération d'images, ce qui se passe, c'est que vous arrivez sur le site PixelGPT, première page, vous avez une liste de modèles. La section Noobie, c'est débutant. La section Noobie Premium, c'est tous les plans entre 0 et 39,99. Donc c'est le plan à 39,99. Noobie Ultimate Premium, c'est les plans entre 0, entre euh entre, excusez-moi. Excusez-moi, erreur, erreur. Noobie, c'est c'est gratuit, tout le monde peut y accéder. Noobie Premium, c'est à partir de 39,99 et tous les plans au-dessus. Noobie Ultimate Premium, c'est tous les plans à partir de 49,99 et tous les plans au-dessus. Noobie Premium Tools, c'est pareil que Noobie Ultimate Premium. Expert, c'est là où vous retrouverez tous les modèles. Donc, j'ai beaucoup de gens, hein, qui pensent que dans Noobie Ultimate Premium, il y a les meilleurs modèles. Non, ce n'est pas le cas. Les meilleurs modèles sont quand même présents dans Expert. Je n'ai pas le temps de faire un card, ce qu'on appelle la petite le petit visuel avec le titre et la saisie de texte. Je n'ai pas le temps de le faire à chaque fois que j'update des modèles. Je suis assez fréquent sur la mise à jour des modèles et il faut savoir que beaucoup de modèles arrivent spontanément ou à des périodes fixes euh en fonction de la demande et que je n'ai pas le temps de préparer les cards. Je suis essentiellement tout seul sur le site web, ça demande beaucoup de travail. Expert, c'est la section où vous trouverez tous les meilleurs modèles. Les meilleurs modèles sont dans la section Expert.

Donc dans la catégorie Noobie, vous retrouvez ce qu'on appelle un un un tiles, des tiles, donc des tuiles et sur ces tuiles-là, vous avez des images de modèles ainsi que leur titre et ce qu'ils peuvent faire. Quand vous cliquez sur une de ces tuiles, vous vous retrouvez sur une interface avec une prévisualisation de l'image, mais aussi une saisie de texte. C'est ici que vous allez pouvoir donc euh générer votre prompt et saisir ce que vous voulez obtenir dans Minecraft.

Le prompt. Qu'est-ce que le prompt ? Comment faire un prompt ? Un prompt, la saisie de texte pour obtenir euh un résultat à travers une image, c'est essentiellement euh la la complexité du prompt dépend de la capacité du modèle. Les modèles dans Noobie sont des modèles bébés, c'est des modèles peu compétents mais assez qualifiés pour générer des images assez cohérentes, mais ils ne comprennent pas forcément le monde de façon très intelligente. Privilégiez des des prompts très courts, succints, explicites, clairs et évitez le jargon. Le jargon, ça peut être dans n'importe quel domaine. Ça peut être le nom d'un personnage dans un animé, ça peut être le nom ou la qualification d'un objet dans un jeu spécifique. Essayez de revenir à son nom d'origine avant de de d'utiliser le nom euh le nom dans le jeu euh alors que le modèle est peut-être pas capable de savoir de quoi on parle. Voilà.

Donc, ici, euh sur la plateforme Text to Minecraft Item Texture 16 by 16 pixels, on peut rentrer par exemple "a diamond sword" en anglais, comme je l'ai dit, hein. Quand je saisis une épée en diamant, j'ai en haut à droite un petit cadran avec une liste de mes générations. C'est là où vous allez pouvoir voir le le progrès de vos générations. Vous pouvez cliquer sur "Update". Des fois, la génération n'apparaît pas systématiquement instantanément. Patientez, il y a beaucoup de de personnes qui peuvent générer à des instants clés sur le site web. Soyez patients, comprenez que vous n'êtes pas le seul et rappelez-vous que quand vous êtes sur un site où c'est gratuit, vous n'êtes pas prioritaire. Déjà, clairement, pour que il soit gratuit, réellement, vous ne fournissez absolument aucune valeur, vous en obtenez en revanche en retour du site web. Donc essayez de comprendre que vous n'êtes pas dans une position de force pour quémander quoi que ce soit. Voilà. Il faut bien le comprendre, c'est évident normalement, mais pour beaucoup de gens, ils pensent que la gratuité, c'est une évidence. La gratuité, ça demande un échange un échange équitable. Là, dans ce cas présent, l'échange n'est pas et ce n'est pas votre prompt qui va qui va enrichir la valeur du site de façon de façon élevée, puisque la qualité de vos prompts sont généralement très mauvaises et elles ne correspondent pas à ce que moi je dois fournir en termes de qualité en fonction de vos prompts.

Une fois que vous avez généré une image, vous vous retrouvez avec une liste d'images sur la partie gauche de votre écran. Sur cette liste d'images, vous pouvez cliquer sur "Hide images" ou "Show images", qui vous permettra de compresser ou décompresser la zone des images générées. Vous avez cinq images qui sont générées. Cliquez sur la dernière qui a le petit icône "new", donc nouveau. Vous cliquez sur "grid". Une fois que vous avez cliqué sur "grid", vous pouvez voir une interface un peu comme un éditeur d'image. Essentiellement ici, on aura deux étapes. On va venir cliquer sur le petit outil magique ici. Et ce petit outil magique, c'est ce qu'on appelle la wand, c'est-à-dire un peu la baguette magique. Cette baguette magique, en fait, qu'est-ce qu'elle va faire ? Elle va venir, elle va nous permettre de retirer l'arrière-plan en fonction de la couleur. Donc essentiellement, c'est un peu comme remplir une zone de transparence. Sauf que des fois, cette zone-là, et ben, elle occupe des parties de l'item qu'on voudrait pas retirer. C'est pour ça que la wand threshold, c'est le niveau à quel point il va regarder des pixels similaires à des pixels blancs. Ça peut être bleu clair, très clair. Et plus le threshold est haut, plus il va être permissif, plus il va sélectionner des pixels qui seront éloignés du blanc. Voilà.

Donc là, en question, le "Remove Color", la couleur sélectionnée, c'est blanc, mais on aurait pu sélectionner par exemple vert. Voilà.

Donc une fois que j'ai mon wand, je vais cliquer sur les zones à supprimer, donc l'arrière-plan en question, hein. Une fois que j'ai fait ça, je vais revenir sur ma petite loupe. Donc toujours revenir sur la petite loupe. Je vais déterminer la taille de pixel. La taille de pixel, essentiellement, ça va dépendre du modèle, c'est pas très clair actuellement sur le site web, il va falloir le déterminer en fonction de l'image. Vous regardez en bas de l'image, essentiellement, et vous voyez, en bas de l'image, vous avez "Select Canvas". Et tout en bas à gauche de l'écran, regardez, "Select Canvas", en bas à gauche, vous allez sur la partie bleue en bas et vous voyez "Select Canvas 512 multiplié par 512". C'est la taille de votre image. Maintenant, qu'est-ce qu'on a dans notre modèle actuellement ? On a quatre items, donc quatre épées dans notre cas. Ces quatre épées, elles ont toutes une résolution de 16 par 16 chacune. Rappelons-nous, on est dans Minecraft. La résolution par défaut, c'est 16 par 16.

Chaque item fait 16 par 16.

Et donc, en 16 par 16,

Chaque item fait 16 par 16. Donc, réfléchissons une seconde. 512. 512 par 512. Donc en réalité, en hauteur, on a 32 pixels, vu qu'on a deux items. En largeur, on a 32 pixels, vu qu'on a encore une fois deux items. Donc, la taille de notre pixel, elle est de combien par, elle est de combien ? Elle est de 512 divisé par 32. Il suffit juste de prendre un côté, de voir le nombre de pixels total et de diviser. Donc 512 divisé par 32, dans notre cas, ça fait 16. Voilà. Donc c'est comme ça que vous obtiendrez la pixel size. Elle peut varier. Des fois, vous aurez des items qui sont soit trop petits, soit trop gros. C'est parce que votre pixel size est pas configuré correctement. Voilà. Donc important de le comprendre, hein. C'est très important, beaucoup de gens le ratent. Une fois donc que vous avez retiré l'arrière-plan, que vous avez déterminé la taille de pixel, donc le pixel size, il va falloir maintenant extraire les les items que vous souhaitez prendre ou utiliser. Donc on va déterminer la taille de la grille. La grid size, généralement, c'est 2 par 2 ou 3 par 3. Vous avez juste à voir le nombre d'items en largeur et en hauteur. Dans notre cas présent, c'est 2 par 2. Une fois qu'on a 2 par 2, qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire ? On clique sur l'item qu'on veut. On fait clic droit et on peut soit le sauvegarder en tant qu'image, soit le copier dans la presse-papier en tant qu'image, soit on peut le sauvegarder sans le redimensionner, donc dans sa taille d'origine. Dans notre cas, ça aurait été 256 par 256. Sauf que nous, actuellement, on veut l'utiliser dans Minecraft, donc c'est du 16 par 16. Privilégiez du 16 par 16. Le stockage augmente forcément, même si ça reste du PNG et que c'est optimisé, le stockage augmente forcément quand la taille d'image est plus grande. Soyez intelligents, utilisez la résolution par défaut de Minecraft qui est 16 par 16.

Dans la section Noobie Premium, là actuellement, c'est la section des utilisateurs payants, ceux qui ont pris un abonnement sur le site.

Dans la section Noobie Premium, essentiellement, vous avez accès à plusieurs modèles. Ce n'est pas forcément les meilleurs modèles du site web. C'est des modèles que j'ai sélectionnés à un instant T et que j'ai présentés sur le site. Il y a des modèles, comme une fois je l'ai répété plusieurs fois, dans Expert qui sont meilleurs pour votre plan. Il s'agit, il est question pour vous d'explorer. Le site n'est pas fait pour vous présenter les meilleurs modèles à tous les instants T. Le site évolue constamment, des changements s'opèrent constamment. Il est difficile de mettre à jour toutes les sections. Je privilégie l'insertion de nouveaux modèles à la présentation des modèles actuellement. C'est peut-être une stratégie que j'ai choisie, peut-être pas la bonne, mais actuellement, c'est la stratégie du site. Donc renseignez-vous dans la page Expert si vous voulez les meilleurs modèles pour votre plan, bien sûr.

Donc dans la section Noobie Premium,

Dans la section Noobie Ultimate Premium, c'est tous les plans à partir de 49,99 jusqu'à euh jusqu'au maximum. Ici, vous aurez des modèles de bien meilleure qualité en termes de suivi de prompt. Donc ils suivront plus facilement vos indications que vous insérez dans le prompt et la qualité des images sera bien meilleure, hein. Je recommande notamment pour les débutants les Ultimate Premium 16px, les quatre premiers que vous voyez en haut de la page. Ils sont vraiment de bonne qualité. Je vous conseille de les utiliser en premier avant d'aller dans la catégorie Expert, parce que je vois tellement de gens qui comprennent absolument rien à ce qu'ils font, qui ne comprennent rien au site web, que des fois, je leur recommande quand même de rester temporairement dans cette section du site web et d'aller plus tard dans la section plus compliquée. Mais voilà.

Donc vous pouvez faire des logos, du pixel art, des assets 2D, et cetera. Donc c'est assez c'est assez permissif en termes de de possibilités. Vous pouvez vraiment faire différents types de d'images. C'est votre imagination qui va limiter à peu près les possibilités et les connaissances du modèle, bien sûr, et ses capacités. Donc il s'agit bien de les comprendre, de les intégrer, de pas voir ses limitations comme une finalité, de comprendre que des fois, c'est vous le problème et non pas le modèle. Et il faut bien essayer de comprendre, c'est un paradigme important. Vous êtes plus souvent le problème que le modèle lui-même. J'ai beaucoup de gens qui sont plus souvent le problème dans pourquoi ça génère pas ce qu'ils veulent que le modèle lui-même. C'est juste qu'ils utilisent pas les bons termes, ils utilisent pas les bons mots, ils comprennent pas ce qu'ils font ou euh ils ils mélangent des concepts ou par exemple, j'ai des gens qui me mettent des JSON, euh qui me qui me mettent des des modèles Blockbench dans le prompt, qui s'attendent à ce que ça ça génère quelque chose de parfait. Il faut comprendre que ce n'est pas une interface multimodale avec je mets tout et n'importe quoi dedans et ça me génère ce que je veux. Ce n'est pas le cas, c'est du texte, c'est limité à un format de texte assez précis, c'est-à-dire le langage naturel, comme on le qualifie, c'est-à-dire la façon dont on parle, et cetera. Il ne s'agit pas d'une saisie où vous pouvez rentrer n'importe quoi et c'est ça vous garantit un résultat parfait. Voilà. J'ai des gens qui me disent que c'est par expérimentation, mais j'ai des gens qui disent "Ah mais moi, je m'attendais à ce que je mette n'importe quoi dedans et que ça ça génère." Non, ce n'est pas une poubelle. Le modèle, son entrée n'est pas une poubelle.

Donc la section Noobie Ultimate Premium est vraiment bien, mais la meilleure que je conseille à beaucoup de gens qui sont dans les dans qui sont assez experts, c'est la section Preset. La section Preset, elle contient vraiment des des outils qui vous permettent vraiment de d'améliorer votre productivité de façon significative. Vous pouvez éditer des items, créer des variations d'items, créer des armures pour des euh des items. Donc vous avez un un un plastron, chestplate, vous avez euh un un pantalon, des bottes et un casque. Vous pouvez générer l'armure en question de Minecraft. Vous pouvez aussi générer générer l'animation d'un item. Animate Items est fait pour ça. Voilà, donc là, il y a différentes possibilités, c'est à vous de les saisir, c'est à vous de les comprendre, c'est à vous de les apprendre. C'est à vous aussi d'expérimenter. Il y a beaucoup de possibilités, il y a beaucoup de personnalisation. Bien sûr, j'essaierai dans ce tutoriel de recouvrir l'ensemble de ce qu'il y a présent dans le site web. Mais encore une fois, il y a beaucoup de parties comme le MC GUI Editor qui prendrait toute une journée à expliquer pour certaines personnes qui n'y comprennent absolument rien. Donc voilà, c'est à vous de d'expérimenter, c'est à vous de voir et c'est à vous de travailler avec le site web. Ce n'est pas le site web qui va réfléchir à votre place, c'est à vous d' de d'apprendre, il est nécessaire pour vous d'apprendre pour pouvoir obtenir le résultat que vous voulez. Voilà.

Donc, je vais partir dans la section Expert. En haut de la section Expert, vous avez le prompt, donc la saisie de texte. Vous avez la Text Accuracy, c'est à quel point vous voulez que le que la génération d'images suive le texte. Vous avez les collections. Donc les collections, si vous allez en haut à droite dans "Account", "My Collection Images", vous pouvez créer des collections d'images et vous pouvez générer dans ces collections, saisir les collections dans lesquelles vous voulez générer des images. C'est bien si vous voulez vous organiser correctement dans votre génération d'images et dans votre processus de création.

Donc on a plusieurs sections dans le modèle Expert. Je sais que le modèle Expert va perdre beaucoup de gens. Sachez que de gauche à droite, c'est du modèle le plus stupide jusqu'au modèle le plus intelligent. Le plus stupide, c'est Baby, le plus intelligent, c'est Orion. Exclusive et Rescue Only, c'est des parties très particulières. Vous voyez ça comme des parties expérimentales qui marchent pas tout le temps. C'est très expérimental ces sections-là. Voilà.

Standard, Pro, Ultimate, Elite, c'est quand même les sections les plus recommandées et les plus intuitives et les plus les plus intéressantes. Baby, c'est les utilisateurs gratuits en soi, ils ont ces modèles-là qu'on voit dans Baby, c'est exactement ça. Standard, c'est les c'est de 39,99 à au-dessus. Pro, Pro, c'est de 39,99 à au-dessus. C'est pour ça que je vous ai dit, hein, à beaucoup de gens, je leur dise, allez dans la section Expert. Pro n'est pas un modèle incompétent, loin de là. Voilà.

Ultimate, c'est à partir de 49.99 jusqu'à au-dessus. Elite, c'est à partir de 99.99 jusqu'à au-dessus. Orion, c'est avec des un nombre de générations limité à partir de 99.99, donc c'est 4 ou 8 par jour, ça va dépendre de comment le plan évolue dans le temps. Et pour euh les le plan à 199, c'est euh 256 générations par jour. Orion est très compétent dans beaucoup de domaines.

Donc quand vous rentrez sur certains de ces modèles, vous avez souvent, hein, c'est répétitif, le "Select this AI model", c'est la partie la plus importante. C'est avant de de générer, cliquez sur "Select this AI model". Généralement, au niveau des versions, c'est la version la plus haute, version 2, 3, 4, euh qui est euh qui génère le mieux. Mais des fois, c'est pas le cas, c'est la version 4. C'est pour ça que j'invite les gens à à expérimenter, hein. Vous pouvez mettre un modèle en favori ou pas. Model Preset, c'est les paramètres du modèle qui seront sauvegardés dans des presets que vous pourrez charger quand vous voulez. Un preset, il a un nom et vous pouvez saisir un nom et enregistrer un preset avec un nom.

Beaucoup de modèles dans la catégorie Expert, quand vous regardez, ils ont ce qu'on appelle un "Select Image References" ou "Style Selector". Le Style Selector, c'est celui qui va conduire la génération, contrôler la génération à travers autre chose que le texte. Ça peut être une image, une image spécifique, et cetera. Donc "Select Image References", pour enregistrer des images dans vos images de référence, vous allez en haut à droite, "Account", "My References Images" et vous uploadez des images ici. Une fois que vous avez uploadé des images, vous revenez sur le Style Selector et là, vous avez plusieurs paramètres. Pas tous les modèles d'IA ne supportent ces paramètres et ils ne sont pas forcément désactivés pour chaque modèle. Ça prend beaucoup trop de temps à configurer. C'est pour ça que si vous voyez une erreur, éventuellement, vérifiez que vous n'utilisez pas des paramètres que le modèle ne supporte pas. C'est important.

Donc les Style 1 et Style 2 settings, ça va récupérer le style de l'image. Comme je l'ai dit, la la section Standard, Pro et Ultimate supportent très fréquemment ces deux paramètres-là, mais le reste ne le supporte pas forcément.

Euh, les Image Shapes, Image and Shape Settings, c'est les plus intéressants. Image Strength, c'est à quel point il va dévier de votre image de base. Donc Image Strength 0, il va dévier 100 % de votre image de base. Image Strength 5, il va dévier 50 % de votre image de base. Donc plus il dévie, plus il va pouvoir peut-être l'améliorer potentiellement, la rendre plus jolie, mais peut-être aussi plus il va être biaisé par l'image. La Shape Strength, c'est essentiellement les contours de chaque élément de votre image. assez précise, et ben la Shape Strength, plus elle est forte, plus elle va influencer la forme de de la génération. La Shape Details, c'est à quel point les petits détails, vous voulez les prendre. Shape Details 0, vous voulez pas les petits détails, mais que les gros détails. Shape Details 10, vous voulez tous les détails, même les plus précis.

Shape Generation pourcentage, c'est important, j'en ai beaucoup de gens qui le mettent à zéro, à zéro, il y a plus rien qui fonctionne, la Shape Strength, elle est à zéro aussi, non plus. Shape Generation, c'est pendant le processus de génération, il part au début de concepts assez abstraits et il va de plus en plus dans le détail. Et ben à quel point vous voulez contrôler les étapes du processus de génération ? Si vous mettez 7, la la forme sera imposée dans les sept premières étapes des 10 étapes, par exemple. Dans les sept premières étapes de génération. Donc les concepts abstraits et plus ou moins détaillés seront forcés de suivre la forme. Par contre, les petits détails, et ben il aura la créativité de faire comme il veut. Voilà.

Overall Style, je conseille de le laisser à 10. Blur Mask, c'est si vous voulez faire du ce qu'on appelle du remplissage de de d'image. Si vous avez une image de base qui a un trou, vous pouvez cliquer sur "Only fill base image mask" et ça va vous permettre de compléter une image. Voilà. Et en fait, ce qu'il va faire, c'est qu'il va prendre le trou et il va le flouter de telle sorte à combler l'image de façon plus transitionnée. Ça va éviter que le ça remplisse le trou de façon booléenne, ça va flouter les bords euh du trou. OK ?

Use Color Style, c'est assez intéressant dans la catégorie Standard, ça va permettre d'imposer un peu de façon un peu plus forte euh la les couleurs euh pendant la génération.

Vous avez Style 1, Style 2, il faut sélectionner vos images, hein, euh pour euh les appliquer aux paramètres. Base, c'est pour l'image de base, comme j'ai dit, Image Strength, et Shape, c'est pour le Shape Strength. Donc si vous avez un Shape Strength à 10 mais que vous avez aucune image sélectionnée dans Shape, ça ne marchera pas. Vous pouvez cliquer le petit bouton, la petite croix rouge pour annuler les paramètres, réinitialiser les paramètres, je veux dire.

Donc il y a beaucoup de modèles, je ne vais pas tous les expliquer ici.

Preset, essentiellement, vous avez Style Match vers Color Palette. Vous allez pouvoir mettre des images et ça va essayer de suivre euh euh euh la palette de couleurs ou différents contrôles que vous pouvez utiliser.

Euh, MC GUI Editor, c'est un éditeur complet de GUI Minecraft, je vais pas en parler en détail, mais c'est assez compliqué. Variant and Recolorize, essentiellement, c'est euh il va recolorier votre item ou il va créer des variations. Donc c'est à utiliser de façon intelligente. Animate Items, vous allez prendre une image de base et vous allez pouvoir l'animer. Je conseille d'utiliser un arrière-plan blanc pour ce ce preset-là. Euh AI Pixel Image Edit Smart, il va vous permettre d'éditer une image existante, de créer une variante de cette image en conservant la palette de couleurs, et cetera, et cetera, ou de la modifier tout simplement. Items to Armor Set, il va permettre de créer l'armure de votre de vos items, donc de votre plastron, et cetera, et cetera.

Favorites, c'est là où vous pourrez trouver vos tous vos modèles favoris.

Explore All Models, dans Features, en haut du site, dans le menu, vous avez Features. Explore All Models, essentiellement, c'est là où vous aurez une barre de recherche pour les modèles. C'est un peu plus pratique pour certains utilisateurs. Ça reste que cette interface, je la conseille pas parce que elle elle elle bénéficie pas de toutes les évolutions. Chat, c'est pour de la génération Mythic Mobs de skill et IML, c'est très particulier, la plupart des gens n'en ont pas besoin. Batch, vous allez pouvoir générer plusieurs images en même temps, en grosse quantité. C'est pour ceux qui veulent créer des textures packs, par exemple.

Config Generator, c'est très spécifique, très particulier, je le conseille pas forcément. Images, c'est là où vous avez tous les utilisateurs gratuits, leurs images sont publiées en public. Par contre, les utilisateurs payants, leurs images sont gardées privées.

Vous pouvez me contacter. Sur les pricings, on a 39,99, 59,99, 49,99, 99.99. Voilà, il y a beaucoup d'options, 199.99, et cetera.

My Pictures, vous allez pouvoir retrouver vos images avec le petit icône de grille, le téléchargement, appliquer un effet magique, copier l'image, rajouter l'image dans une collection. Donc vous pouvez rajouter des images dans vos collections.


Voici la transcription chronologique et complète de la vidéo, incluant le dialogue et le texte affiché à l'écran.

### 00:00 - 00:15 : Introduction et création du projet

**Audio :**
Hello, my name is Alex and in this video I'll try to teach you how to create a Minecraft GUI as fast as possible. So basically, please look in the description, the resources are available in the description. We will choose a GUI.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   Logo Photopea
*   Nouveau projet
*   Ouvrir depuis l'ordinateur
*   Modèles
*   Installer Photopea
*   Drop any files here
*   Icônes de types de fichiers : PSD, AI, XD, fig, sketch, PDF, XCF, RAW, ANY

**(L'utilisateur ouvre l'explorateur de fichiers et sélectionne plusieurs images .png)**

**Audio :**
So first you go on Photopea.

### 00:15 - 00:26 : Configuration de la toile et importation de l'image de base

**Audio :**
New. You select 256 by 256. Create. Once you're there, you can go on the folder, drag and drop. So we got our GUI.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   Menu Fichier > Nouveau... (Alt+Ctrl+N)
*   Fenêtre "Nouveau projet" :
    *   Nom : Nouveau projet
    *   Largeur : 1280 (modifié à 256)
    *   Hauteur : 720 (modifié à 256)
    *   Pixels
    *   Bouton "Créer"
*   (L'utilisateur glisse-dépose l'image `generic_54.png` sur la toile)
*   Panneau Calques :
    *   generic_54
    *   Background

### 00:26 - 01:06 : Explication du concept du GUI (dans Paint)

**Audio :**
The base idea of a GUI, I will draw it here. So this was the previous example. Um, the base idea of a GUI is to make a shop GUI. So we have a GUI like this. We have some slots at the bottom. I'm very bad at drawing. And in the middle, we have basically something like, yeah, a grid of a 4x4 slot. And we have an arrow here, an arrow here, the menu button here, right? So that's the base idea. Uh, it's to create a shop. We will have some decorations to make it look better with some things here and things here.

**Texte à l'écran (Microsoft Paint) :**
*   (L'utilisateur dessine une esquisse grossière de l'interface utilisateur d'un magasin, avec une grille d'objets en haut, des flèches de navigation et un bouton "home" en dessous, et l'inventaire du joueur en bas.)

### 01:06 - 01:35 : Modification de l'image de base dans Photopea

**Audio :**
So, once we are on Photopea, we will center the GUI. We zoom. So you can use the button here for zoom. And we will erase the top part. We select the top part. We select the color. We right-click, pixelate. And we fill with the brush. So that's it for the top part. We start with that. Then we are going literally to duplicate... see here... copy fused...

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   (L'utilisateur centre l'image `generic_54.png` sur la toile blanche.)
*   (L'utilisateur zoome sur l'image.)
*   (L'utilisateur utilise l'outil Sélection rectangulaire pour sélectionner la grille supérieure.)
*   (L'utilisateur sélectionne l'outil Pipette et clique sur le fond gris de l'interface.)
*   (Clic droit sur le calque `generic_54` > Pixéliser)
*   (L'utilisateur utilise l'outil Pinceau pour peindre sur la grille supérieure avec la couleur grise sélectionnée, la faisant disparaître.)
*   (L'utilisateur sélectionne une grille de 4x4 dans la partie inférieure.)
*   Menu Édition > Copier avec fusion (Maj+Ctrl+C)
*   (L'utilisateur colle la sélection, qui apparaît sur un nouveau calque "Calque 1".)
*   (L'utilisateur déplace le "Calque 1" vers le haut de l'interface.)

### 01:35 - 02:00 : Création des icônes de navigation

**Audio :**
Right. And we will start making the arrow. So for the arrow, basically, we're going to create a new layer. I hold shift to keep the selection. Now what I can do is duplicate. Edit, transform, flip horizontally. And we will put now our a little home.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   (L'utilisateur crée un nouveau calque "Calque 2".)
*   (L'utilisateur utilise l'outil Lasso polygonal pour dessiner une flèche pointant vers la gauche.)
*   (La sélection est remplie avec une couleur gris foncé.)
*   (Le calque "Calque 2" est dupliqué en "Calque 2 copie".)
*   Menu Édition > Transformer > Retourner horizontalement
*   (La flèche de droite est créée et positionnée.)
*   (Un nouveau calque "Calque 3" est créé.)
*   (L'utilisateur dessine une icône de maison et la remplit de couleur.)
*   (Les trois icônes - flèche gauche, maison, flèche droite - sont alignées au centre.)

### 02:00 - 03:36 : Coloration et décoration du GUI

**Audio :**
So basically, we have the base GUI. The idea is to make the AI enhance the overall GUI, make it a little bit more beautiful. So what we are going to do now, we are going to duplicate, fuse, to create a folder. So this is just a backup folder. And we'll start working from there. So, um, now we duplicate the layer and we're going to colorize. So we want something pretty brown. We want brownish color for the background. So we... yeah, we paint it. But on this side, we want some special thing. We want to make it like a market. We will put some blue colors. Alt to subtract. So that's the base idea of our GUI. Um, so we will just add... Now we're going to do something. We're going to revert back to this. We're going to select here like this. We revert back to this and we're just going to paint the details we want to add one by one. It will be really, really, uh, not precise at all my painting. I did a mistake. Try to be a little bit precise too to avoid issues after. Um, that's it I think. We can go here and... I don't know how to make a cross. Um, okay. Let's do something like this. We select shape... where is it? Yeah, it's here.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   (Les calques des icônes et de la base sont dupliqués et fusionnés dans un dossier "Dossier 1" pour sauvegarde.)
*   (Un nouveau calque est créé au-dessus de la base du GUI.)
*   (L'utilisateur sélectionne l'outil Baguette magique et clique sur le fond gris.)
*   (L'utilisateur choisit une couleur marron et remplit la sélection avec l'outil Pot de peinture.)
*   (L'utilisateur sélectionne la zone supérieure et la zone autour de la grille 4x4.)
*   (Il choisit une couleur turquoise et la remplit.)
*   (L'utilisateur utilise l'outil Pinceau pour dessiner une forme rouge en haut, ressemblant à un auvent de magasin.)
*   (Il dessine ensuite deux formes marron sur les côtés de la grille 4x4.)

### 03:36 - 04:03 : Préparation des images pour l'IA (Pixel GPT)

**Audio :**
Right, so we have some base. Let's be honest, it's not nice at all. It's a very, very horrible base. It's not quite... The end goal is not to make something nice. So, we have our base GUI. We're going to ask the AI to enhance this GUI. So we will export it as "base_shape". And the second one, we are going to add noise, Gaussian. You can leave it as 20%. Export... and it was the name "base_image_noise". Right. I missed... I failed the naming. Now we can go here, account, my reference images. So we added our two images.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   Menu Fichier > Exporter en tant que > PNG
*   (L'image est sauvegardée sous le nom `base_shape.png`.)
*   Menu Filtre > Bruit > Ajout de bruit...
*   Fenêtre "Ajout de bruit" :
    *   Taux : 20%
    *   Répartition : Gaussien
    *   Monochrome (coché)
*   (L'image avec du bruit est sauvegardée sous le nom `base_image_noise.png`.)

**Texte à l'écran (Site web Pixel GPT) :**
*   (L'utilisateur navigue vers la section "My Reference Images" et télécharge les deux fichiers PNG créés.)

### 04:03 - 05:26 : Génération d'image avec l'IA

**Audio :**
And now we go in expert. Ultimate Pixel Art 250... Ultimate Extreme MC GUI Alpha version 1. We select this AI model. We will put a great prompt: "a beautiful shop double chest cartoon gui with empty slots at the bottom and a beautiful shop interior at the top with on top a 4x4 slots grid in the middle with many decorations and details". I'm just going to add a very important word: "cartoon", because we want something in cartoon style and it helps getting better results. So we use the image with noise as base and the one with no noise as shape. Image strength 1, shape strength 7, shape affected by small details a lot. So copy the settings here. We are at 4 for shape affects percent of generation. I'm just going to make a little change like this. Right, now we can start generating. So the first result, let's look. Honestly, it's not that bad. It has some theme around shop but this chest and... yeah. Maybe we can wait for the second result.

**Texte à l'écran (Site web Pixel GPT) :**
*   Page "EXPERT"
*   Modèle sélectionné : Ultimate extreme mc creative item 256 v1
*   Bouton "SELECT THIS AI MODEL"
*   Champ de texte "Enter Text (OSYU Forbidden!)" : `a beautiful shop double chest cartoon gui with empty slots at the bottom and a beautiful shop interior at the top with on top a 4x4 slots grid in the middle with many decorations and details`
*   Section "Select Image References" :

    *   Image Strength
    *   Shape Strength
    *   Shape Affected By Small/Transparent details
    *   Shape affects percent of Generation
*   Bouton "Generate Image"
*   (L'IA génère une première image de GUI de magasin de style pixel art.)

### 05:26 - 07:40 : Amélioration et finalisation du GUI

**Audio :**
Okay, the second result is really good. It's exactly what I was asking for. A shop detail on top, you see. Yeah, this one is really good. So you see, the icons went out and it can happen. One trick sometimes is to make them more distinguishable from here, you see. But it's pretty good already. What you can do after that, if you want to add, you can just go on... if I remember well... 16... there's an icon model if I'm not wrong... Icon 16px speed. So there's an icon 16px speed. You can just say "a home button", "left arrow", and you can duplicate the left arrow and flip it. So I'll do it for you because I know some people are completely off when it comes to photo editing. So this is before/after. You see the pattern? There's slightly a pattern in the shape, in where things are placed, you see? If you see... it really fills the button... In fact, we could... I'm not going to do it here but we can just crop and you would get something near... Also, if you want to do some edits because the colors are a little bit off from what I see, I would do something brighter here. And you could select... wait, it's late but you get the idea. You can place the icons where you want and you can get your GUI at the end as you want.

**Texte à l'écran (Site web Pixel GPT) :**
*   (Une deuxième image de GUI de magasin est générée, plus détaillée.)
*   (L'utilisateur change de modèle pour "icon 16px speed".)
*   Il entre le prompt "a home button" et génère une icône de maison.
*   Il entre le prompt "left arrow" et génère une icône de flèche.
*   Il utilise l'outil "Image Grid Generator" pour séparer les icônes générées.

**Texte à l'écran (Photopea) :**
*   (L'utilisateur importe le GUI généré par l'IA.)
*   (Il importe l'icône de maison, supprime son fond avec la Baguette magique et la place sur le GUI.)

### 07:40 - Fin : Conclusion et autres fonctionnalités

**(La vidéo change brusquement pour montrer un autre tutoriel sur la création de sprites de personnages.)**

**Audio (Nouveau tutoriel) :**
Hello, my name is Alex. In this video, I will showcase to you how you can create a spreadsheet for any kind of character, object, animals. So basically, you have two first requirements. You need some basic knowledge of image editors. If you don't know how to use an image editor, you don't know what is a layer, you don't know what is an image, what are pixels, what are a selection, what is a paintbrush or anything like this, you shouldn't be able to do it and you need to learn those before trying to do anything at all. Basically, if you have some basic knowledge of image editing, you can then use an existing spreadsheet. I will use this one. Once you have an existing spreadsheet, what you need to do is remove the background. If you have a background, you right-click, pixelate, and then you select the white area, you hit delete on your keyboard and you've deleted the white area. So basically, I will leave a white background because the white background is important. You need still to leave a white background, but the layer concerning the character should be half-light transparent, if you see what I mean. The background transparent. So once you're there, you select the layer, you go into filter, you go into noise, you go into add noise, then you go into repartition, you select Gaussian, you specify 45. You hit OK. You go on file top left, export PNG and you export. Remember your base image must be a 256 by 256 image. This is a requirement. Don't try to mess up with that value. Please use 256 or 128 by 128. All right. So I think you get the idea. I've already done that work already. You need to go into your account, my image references here like you see, and then in my image references, you upload the images. I already did that. You then go in the Pixel GPT main page, you go into the expert section, then you hit ultimate pixel art 256 pixel. And for my preference, but you can use any model. Here, I will use ultimate extreme MC creative item 256. You click select this AI model. Then you go at the bottom of the page, select image references. Now, please follow carefully the settings and make sure you don't mess that up. Half of the people messes it up. They messes up a setting. So follow carefully, please. I know this is a complex part, but please follow carefully. Basically, the image strength should be between 0 and 1. 0 and 1. 0, you want something really creative, honestly. It will mess up sometimes. 1, it's stable. Then you select the images. For the images, make sure you select a shape, the original image. So the one without noise actually. This is without noise. And for the shape image here, you see shape. And then you go into the base one and you say the base one, the one with noise. Please. So image strength 1, shape strength around 5, between 5 and 7. It's your choice. I selected 5. 5 is mean more creativity, 7 less creative. But sometimes it's too affected by the original image shape. Affected by small, you put it to a max shape. Affects percent of generation half. If you want more accurate shapes, so it follows more closely the original image shape, put higher. I will leave it at 5 for now. Then click apply selections. Once you're there, you can now detail your prompt. Remember, your prompt can be creative, can give some instructions, but remember the original image is already guiding the final image. So if you ask for a dress, you can, you can try, yes, you can try but you shouldn't be 100% sure it will work. I will try with some specific instructions. So you see the prompt how I specified it. Coherent spreadsheet, very important. The prompt is key. Coherent spreadsheet of a magnificent cute girl, beautiful hair, only working on white background. Only working, very important. It already helps the AI understand what the base image is. On white background, very important. The editing part we will work with is basically beautiful hair and cute girl. So I want a very cute girl. You can use as much adjectives as possible. It's always useful. But try to not put too many adjectives at... very cute girl with red trouser and brown hairs, only walking on etc, etc. settings like that. Now you can click hit generate image. Now you need to be patient. Let's see our image. So we can see it here actually. So you can see it has followed the prompt quite accurately. So we have a red trouser, brown... did I say brown? I don't remember. Brown hairs, yeah. So it followed closely what I asked and it's actually using the animation position accurately. So this is really useful if you want to create multiple variations. Now we will try a more complex one because I know this is the simple one. Actually, a girl with a red trouser with a red dress. This is going to be complicated. I will do some manipulations in order for it to be more... it has more probability to work, but it can mess up. It's what I'm scared. It messes up sometimes when I do that. Anyway, we will try it. Red dress, you see? I managed to make it work slightly. But I think it messed up. And why I say it messed up, you see the arms. Sadly, the arms aren't working. So yeah, she lost a leg also. This is why shape is something you can play with, but obviously you won't always get perfect results if you use a lower shape. I've imported my two images just as before. We put just base for this one. Oh no. Base for this one, sorry. And shape for this one. Leave the settings the same. Shape strength, I think it was there. And we can start with that. I think it's pretty good. You'll see the difference will be quite important there because you see before it was trying to apply a dress with the shape of a girl which had some like only jeans or similar like jeans legs. Right now we are going through a different manner. We are trying to help the AI get it. But you see so well, you don't need to be an artist to draw that dress. Honestly, you don't need to be an artist. Yes, you need to know some basic drawing stuff if you're going to start like this. And the second one like this, the third one like this, it's obvious at some point. I know some people for some people it's not always obvious, but if you mess up the base image, you will mess up the final image. It's obvious you need to consider that properly. So you see there, so this is the first generation. Nothing stops you from doing another generation. Nothing stops you from doing a second try, right? Because I see a lot of people who are like, oh no, it doesn't work on the first try. Just do a second try. It's not impossible. So you see the arms are pretty good for the animation. It's quite what I was expecting. For here, not perfect, but there's some sense. Maybe if I increase the shape a little bit, it will get better. I just ask you to do some trials. I think you get the idea of a shape. If you put a slightly higher shape, we'll try that. It will catch my arms. What I'm scared with higher shape sometimes is it follows too much the original image and it can mess up. Second try, not bad. We've got, you see, when I increase the shape, the animation of the arms is a little bit better. It's like a really a walking animation at that point, I'd say. So I know there isn't like so much difference, but the left arm is a little bit more to the front than the right arm. So that's the idea. I think you get the idea. From there, you'll tell me this is not a perfect sprite sheet. I know. This isn't. I adapted the spreadsheet so that it fits into 256 by 256. You have two choices. Either you use a program where you delimitate the zones like for the spreadsheets for every sprite with black and white patterns and you create a script that extracts the images. You can do that. It's not very difficult to program. Just a bit of a programming skill. If you have no skill in programming, no skill in image editing, obviously this task for you is too complicated or is out of your skills until you learn them. So what I recommend everyone is to learn some skills. Even CGPT can help you with. You just have to specify. Basically, you split the image into a grid of white and black rectangles. Make sure they are purely black and white or it will get some very bad results. From there, you can recreate the original spreadsheet with the right separation between the characters. So I know this isn't a perfect solution. There might be a solution where you can directly input your spreadsheet later that will come where you're not restricted by this 256 by 256. There is actually, in fact, you can already try it without using this resolution. Why I ask you to use 256 by 256 is because sometimes some people just take like completely random resolutions. They take 1000 by 1000. Yes, because you didn't restore it to the right pixel size. So I need for those people who aren't really image editors or anything like that, force them to use 256 by 256. But if you're smarter and that you have already the technical background etc, you can, you should know that you can use different resolutions as long as they are not too big like 384. It starts to be too big. All right, I hope you enjoyed this video. Don't hesitate to leave a like, to subscribe. If some more tutorials like this about spreadsheets, tiles, etc, interest you a lot, please leave a comment and specify it. I follow tutorials and I do tutorials based on the people direction they ask me to. If you ask me to do this, this, this, I will try to help you make that. Hope you enjoyed this video. See you soon. Bye.

**(La vidéo change pour montrer l'interface du site web Pixel GPT.)**

**Audio :**
What you see here are different images generated with Pixel GPT, and you only see 30% of the whole collection of available models. From Minecraft texture to illustration, Pixel GPT can do it all. First, to visit the website, go in the description. The link is deep-pixels.com. So before the tutorial begins, you need to know what Pixel GPT is. Pixel GPT is a website with multiple different tools to generate textures, 3D render, illustrations, and more. Yes, you can make a full Minecraft armor set. Yes, you can make items for the Stardew video game. Yes, make different resolutions pixel art. Yes, you can do all that. So first off, for those who are impatient to generate a 16 pixels Minecraft item, just click on this card. Then you have this user interface where you can input some text in the green box and then click generate. Now, be patient because you probably are a free user, you will have to wait for a server to take your image generation request and process it. It's not instantaneous. You will see your generated image appear on this left bar. So now let's review the different parts of the website. We will go into each part in this video, but one thing you must remember is if you don't know what a texture is, you don't know what an image is, or you don't know what alpha channel or transparency for a PNG image is, there is high chance you have a lack of knowledge about how images work, how Minecraft uses textures. So please, before going further in this video, make sure to learn about those different topics. Many users mixes the terms 3D render with blockbench model or think that Minecraft uses 3D assets for swords where it's only extruding the texture. So lack of knowledge is the most common issue when user want to learn how to use the website. So first, please make sure to create an account and log in. You will be able to see the images you have generated. So regarding the menu, we have first home, which is this page, then chat for Mythic Mobs skill generation, batch to generate a lot of images simultaneously, config generator to use AI for generating Minecraft server plugin YAML configurations, images to see all the free users only generated images, status to see if the generation server is alive, the rest are administrator pages you can ignore. You can contact me through Discord or through the contact page and you can see premium plans. Now next, we are going to concentrate ourselves on the different sections of the website. Like you can see here, there are different pages for different kind of users. There is newbie, newbie premium, newbie premium tools for AI image processing tools, and the expert section. Let's get back to newbie page. You see those four different cards with image, they are different image generation models. Read their titles to understand what they generate. When clicking on them, you see we arrive on an interface where we can ask them what we want to generate. But we can then go in newbie premium. Premium means you need a paid account to use them. The premium models are way much more powerful, they understand your prompt much better and the image quality can be exponentially better. Just like the newbie AI models, we can select a model and ask it what we want to generate. For this example, let's generate a crossbow. So now let's speed up the time a little bit until it's finished generating. Now we have our crossbows generated. We can either download all of them or click on the grid button. With this tool, we can actually separate the different items into different images. We can remove the background color and can even keep some badly removed pixels by clicking on the picture one by one. It may take some time, but you can perfectly extract items from an image. You can also change the background color, but for most models, you shouldn't worry too much about changing it. We will now focus on newbie premium tools and especially one tool in particular, the palette recolorizer tool. Please, before doing anything, read the usage tip in yellow. You can then drag and drop same-size images with transparency onto the UI. We will transform this diamond set into a gold set. Sometimes you need to change the prompt a bit because the AI might get stuck on some items. Once generated, we can then separate the items. This time we need to be careful. We are on a 3x3 grid of items. Each pixel size is 1... it's why the UI is a bit broken with such a small image size. We then must select all the images and download them. We can even preview what the entire recolored set looks like in an image editor like Photopea. Now, before diving into the expert page and the other pages, let's talk about the premium plans. There are four plans, only yearly plans or six-month plans exist. The reason for it is it actually costs a lot to deliver all those services. Some people will be critical and say that everything should be free, although those people are never really the ones creating real working products. So all the plans you see on the page let you generate an infinite amount of images, but where the different plan levels intervene are on the number of simultaneous generation requests you can make and the priority for your image to be taken by a generation server. So a bigger plan means you will be able to make more generation requests simultaneously and you will have priority over other users. Also, bigger plans give you access to way much more batch generations in the batch page. We will see more about the batch page later in this video. And of course, with those plans, you can access all the premium models of the website that are locked for free users. Now we are in the expert page. Remember, we clicked on it before. People are scared about this page, mainly due to its complexity and the number of tabs. Though experienced artists or Minecraft server owners might recognize most of those terms here, I will explain them to you step by step. Follow closely. First, when you want to use a model, you can't search using some kind of search bar. This is a functionality that might be implemented in the future. Though in the expert section, you actually have access to absolutely all the models of the website. Newbie premium tab only hosts not even 5% of all the models available. So to simplify the explanation, I will describe visually what each part does and means from top to bottom. At the top, we have a large white text box. It's actually where you type what you want to generate. A good tip is to use this pattern for prompting the AI: subject + adjectives like "diamond blue and red". It's a pretty stupid example, but it can work. Also, remember the AI models are not fully aware about everything that exists in Minecraft or other games. Sometimes describing literally visually how an item or creature looks like is better than giving it its in-game name. For example, instead of asking for an elytra, you can ask for "two angel wing black". It's visually similar and it can help the AI understand what you want. So that's all for the white text box part. Now the text accuracy, think it as the bigger the value, the more the generation will look like what you asked in the prompt, but in return, the image quality is worse and can show some weird glitches. On the contrary, a lower value gives better visual quality but doesn't always follow correctly the prompt. Now let's look under text accuracy into the tab section. What you see here are nested tabs. The deeper or lower you go through these tabs, the more precise you get. So baby, standard, and pro means different model size. What does it mean exactly? Well, it means that the bigger the AI model you use, the better it is. It's as simple as that. Baby is not very capable, pro is very capable but a bit slow. So if you click on each model size tabs, they all have different categories. Those categories varies depending on the model size and might change in the future. But let's take pixel art and illustration. Well, all models under pixel art are only models doing pixel art images. Models under illustration only do illustrations images. It's as simple as that. Now when you select a category, you can see its subcategories. For pixel art, for example, we have 16px, 32px, and pixel-mat. Well, all models under 16px subcategory are making images in 16x16 pixels. All so as simple as that. And pixel art models are doing by default 128x128 pixels images. Once we have selected a subcategory, we can select an actual AI model. Hooray! Here we can only see baby 16px, but there would be way much more models. Look in standard for example. Each model can have multiple versions from one to as many as possible. Most of the time, you want to use the biggest version available. Well, we now have selected a version for our model. We can then select the model itself. Again, yes, it's a bit weird, but you have to do it. You must click on the green button "select this AI model". Then you can click on the green button "generate image" and now you have to wait for the image to generate. Be patient, like I said before, it's not instantaneous. So now we will concentrate ourselves on style selector or select image references feature. One caveat is that sometimes the AI doesn't generate actually what you want or it doesn't look like it because like said before, the AI doesn't know everything about all games in the world like Minecraft and sometimes she might fail on certain tasks. To solve this issue, sometimes using the pro models actually helps, but sometimes you might have to use the style selector feature. So to use this feature, visit any models inside the expert section and find one that supports style selector feature. For demonstration, we will use first a 16 pixels model. To demonstrate the capabilities of those features, we will use a simple Minecraft item. What we actually want is the same item but in different material. By same item, I mean the exact same shape. For that, follow this process closely. First, you want to take the item, make sure it's in the correct image size. For a 16px model, we actually need to provide a 16x16 image. Careful, many users put some random size images or doesn't check the image size and experience some bad results. You need to respect the model pixel size rules in order for it to work, right? Now we need to put the image inside my image references page, upload your item there in a new page. Now let's get back to our model. We click on style selector or select image references feature. You now get this interface. Please for newbie, click on the help button, everything is described. Now once again, let's review the different sections of this interface from top to bottom. At the top, we can see a section with our images we have uploaded. On each image, you can see a checkbox and two radio buttons. Checkbox means you can select multiple images, the max is 16, and the radio button means you can select only one of the images. So the checkbox you see here is for the style. What does it mean to copy a style? Mostly two factors can be taken into account: the composition and color palette. By copying the style, you kind of teach the model how you want the images to look like. The two radio buttons are for base image and shape. Normally, when we generate an image, we start from some random noise and then the AI removes step by step that noise until it looks like what you asked in your prompt. But you can actually instead start from any image you want rather than noise. This helps the AI on choosing the right colors for the image and adjusting the position, placement, and rotation of the elements in the image. Think it as an artist that instead of starting from scratch, starts from your face but can do anything with it. So the base image helps the AI know what colors to use, what composition to follow, and more. Then we have the shape feature. Just as said previously, sometimes you want the shape to be exactly like in an image. For that, you can use the shape feature. The shape feature will force the AI to follow the same shape, but she can't see the colors in the image. Think it as the silhouette of someone at sunset, but the AI can't see his face but must really draw someone with the same silhouette. For our example, we actually said we wanted to have a Minecraft leggings but in a different material. So just to check you followed the explanations, let's do a simple quiz to check that you've understood everything with this Minecraft leggings example. Choose between one or more choices between those statements. One, I must check the style checkbox to copy the style of the leggings to be the same. Two, I must check the base image because I need to copy the leggings. Three, I must check the shape image because I want a similar leggings to the one I already have. Read carefully each statement and choose one or more statements that you think are correct. The right answer is the third one only. If you chose another statement, please listen carefully the previous explanations. So why don't we check the style then? Did we say we want to copy the colors or style? No, right. And as for the base image, do we actually want a similar material to the leggings? No, right. So the only valid statement is the shape. No, we don't want to copy the colors or style. We want to copy the shape and make a different material out of it. So now we have chosen our shape image. Now I will explain all those settings below starting from style strength. Style strength is valid only if you have selected some style images. It's not our case here, but note that style strength means how much should we influence the style of the generated image based on the selected style images. It's not our case here, so we can ignore this setting. Image strength is if you have selected a base image. It's not our case here. So once again, we can ignore this setting. Now shape strength parameter actually interests us a lot. We need to use this setting to determine how much we want the AI to respect the shape of our selected shape image. But remember, a too big shape strength means a flat image with no details, so we must find a balance in between in pair with the shape strength percent of generation parameter that we will see later. Shape affected by small transparent details parameter means do you want the AI to capture small details when detecting the shape? Most of the time, you want this pretty high. Now, shape affects percent of generation is a parameter to always use with shape strength. A little free tip, a value of 7 for shape strength and 7 for shape affects percent of generation is pretty good most of the time. So shape affects percent of generation parameter means for how long during the generation process should we force the AI to generate something to follow the shape, which means for example for a value of 7, the first 7 steps it will force at strength 7 since we chose shape strength 7 earlier to generate something that looks like the shape and the rest of the time, the AI can do anything she wants based on the previous steps result. To summarize, the first 7 steps, the AI followed the shape and the rest of the three steps, she don't have to follow the shape and so she can add nice details onto the image. Always try to experiment with those settings and try to find the one that fits the best. You won't always get a perfect image on first shot. Many users just give up after the first try and it's sad because you can do so much with this tool if you are willing to experiment with it. So let's get back to our explanations. The parameter overall style strength, you shouldn't ever change it, but it can sometimes help in reducing the stylized effect of the model. The use color palette parameter is working only if you have selected at least one style image. You can ask the AI to only copy the color palette and not the style of the selected style images. It's not our case here, so we will ignore it. Use color style parameter tries to force the AI to use the same color palette. Once again, you will have to experiment to find the right setting. So now I will demonstrate what you should select for our leggings. Finally, we can do a diamond leggings in nearly the same shape as our red leggings. Of course, since we set the shape strength on around 7, you'll see that it won't follow perfectly the same shape, but you can increase the value yourself if you need it to. So here is our result. We can actually see that we have a diamond leggings. It's not perfect, but we can actually see that it has partially followed the shape we asked it. Remember also to use the prompt to help the AI in guiding its generation. So I've pushed the limit of the style selector further. I just to demonstrate what you can actually achieve in terms of result when you're doing using style selector. So yes, I've zoomed in. So what you're seeing here is a zoomed in version. I can zoom out if it's too scary, but just to see the image, I will zoom in, okay? Um, so as a base image, I've used, you see this spreadsheet. I've added some noise a bit randomly around the character, but not on the eye. And I ask for a man. I use this as style, so it's very important. So here, I just to say here, I'm in any pixel size model. So if you go under pixel art, so under standard pixel art, any pixel size, custom any size pixel art, I'm here. I've selected it. I've selected 8 for 112, 2 for 172. What does both mean? The model has been trained on different resolutions. You're kind of asking it to use 80% of this training and 20% of this training and 0% of this one. I select the size, so it's 128 by 192. And that's it. And then you have to select the image references like I did before. And you got it. And once you generate the image, you can download it. And yes, okay, right. And you can see what it has generated after. You need to purchase credits. Why isn't it included inside the premium plan? Because it's using an external system. It's not using my GPUs like it's the case right now for everything. It's using another API which is very costly, which costs a lot actually. So seeing 1000 credits for this price, trust me, it's pretty low. So you can pay for the model and get it at full low price, the lower price possible. But that's the idea. You can actually also... I forgot chat. I will go into chat after that. You can actually, um, a magical block, a magical crystal block. I'll hit generate. In between, we'll go into the chat page. Chat, I'll be very fast. Um, yes, you ask for a mythic mob skill, you get a mythic mob skill as simple as that. You can't ask him stupid questions. It's not an assistant. It's just for mythic mob. If you don't know what mythic mob is, you don't need to use this page probably. So that's the idea. Um, so, uh, yes, a little thing I didn't specified. So it has generated with AI.

So seeing 1000 credits for this price, trust me, it's pretty low. So you can pay for the model and get it at full low price, the lower price possible. But that's the idea. You can actually also... I forgot chat. I will go into chat after that. You can actually, um, a magical block, a magical crystal block. I'll hit generate. In between, we'll go into the chat page. Chat, I'll be very fast. Um, yes, you ask for a mythic mob skill, you get a mythic mob skill as simple as that. You can't ask him stupid questions. It's not an assistant. It's just for mythic mob. If you don't know what mythic mob is, you don't need to use this page probably. So that's the idea. Um, so, uh, yes, a little thing I didn't specified. So it has generated with AI.

Pixel GPT - documentation
Beginner - You should read !
90% of the question you are asking yourself are here
Pixel GPT is an AI (Artificial intelligence) website that let you generate various kind of content from textures, blockbench 3D Model and Mythic mob skill.
If you have a génération stuck click delete 6 times.

Top Information for beginners related the Paid plan (read !) :
First of all, question always asked, Yes you have unlimited generations with any of the premium plan in the duration of your pricing plan,
the limitation will be your queue and priority (Yes batch number is limited, but it has nothing to do with generation number, its for the batch page! more info on batch section)

premium users (who paid), the generations are private, only you can see them.
free users, the generations are public anyone can see them.
Free users are limited to 128 images (not renewable)

the bigger the queue, the more simulteanous generations you can do.
the more priority, the faster your generation wil be picked up by a generation server over the other users. 
Beginners, concepts and specificity to understand :
What can the website actually generate with AI ??

By content generation I mean :

Minecraft textures, understand that a texture can be an item (sword, pickaxe...), a 3D model texture (carefull its what we apply to a 3D model to look nice, not a 3D Model itself)... is actually an image (its not a 3D object, minecraft actually extrude the textures to look 3D).
The textures can be of different resolutions : 12px, 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px, 192px, 256px... (px = pixel)

3D Blockbench: (currently bad result <- read announcements and release if improvements on discord) - The 3D Blockbench models is actually a workflow of : prompt -> image -> 3D Cubes. The predicted 3D cubes can be highly innacurate.

3D Render image, carefull, its not 3D object, for example : films like Pixar, you see characters moving inside a 3D environment, but the actual animation is a set of multiple 2D images called each 3D render.
So yes the website can generate various 3D render images of minecraft scenes with very nice colors and composition.

Illustration images (carefull its not an svg or vector file, its an image) : You can generation various kind of illustrations with the cartoon models.

Look in the website, don't think an AI model doesn't exist for what you think, for example GUI are actually in Pixel art -> 256px !!
I want to generate now !
There is a lot of models, keeping the organisation easy for a user all in one place is challenging,
Take the time to explore each of the options, a lot of people are asking me about models that already exist in the website !
Why are there a lot of 16 px models, or 32px models... ?
Because each of them has a lot of features, different styles etc ...
You must explore to find out !

The website has a multitude of features, there are differents tabs :
Home :
The page where you can generate various kind of content (images, items, ..) using AI.
There are different categories (Pixel art, 3D Render ...)
Each category is made of section,
Each section is made of AI Models with various names.
Each AI Models has multiple versions.

A. To generate now :

If you want a minecraft item in 16px, for example, go to :
Category : Pixel Art
Section: 16px
Model: Ultra 16 Basic
Version: Version 2

Then enter text inside the prompt at the top (please do not prompt like : I want a very nice blue sword with flowers for my minecraft server -> use : blue sword with flowers).

Then click generate at the bottom of the website and wait, it is not instantaneous !
The generations can sometimes disepear, please create an account and at the top right of the website, click on My Images, you will find back your generations.
The progress bar is not accurate and can sometimes freeze or go too fast, if a generation is not appearing after a long time, click 6 times delete.
The blockbench 3D Model is slow, be patient and click on 3D button at the end, no images will appear that's normal ! its a zip of blockbench (bbmodel) files.
Batch generation page
You are a texture pack maker, you want to generate a bunch of images simulteanously, you can with this feature, depending on your price options you can generate a batch of images with a list of prompt.
If you did all you batch generations of your price plan in 24 hours, the next 24 hours it will reset don't worry.
Don't mix the batch feature with the images you can generate, batch is limited, but not the images you can generate on Home page !

When you want to generate a batch, you must select the category, the section.
Then select a model.

A text prompt with multiple line input will appear.
YOu can then enter one item prompt per line.

Click Generate and then follow progress on batch list tab, click on the green line.
Refresh the page, but be patient, it takes time and it occupies your generation queue ! (you can't generate on Home page until your batch is finished).

Chat Page :
You can ask for mythic mob skills (mythic mob is a minecraft server plugin, if you don't know what it is, look on google).

You can ask it for mythic mob skills, it takes 3 minutes per prompt, please come back later and see in your chat history if generation appears, it doesnt update like chat gpt in real time.
I want to use style selector to make a GUI.
So if you want to copy the style of an image or multiple images, or make a Minecraft GUI (with premium models).

You must use style selector option button (not available on all models) (its a green button at th top of the model options).

Upload images to reference images tab ( top right of the website, click drop down, My reference images, there you can add images).

Once on the style selector GUI.
You must provide images in the same resolution of the model, for 16px models, give 16px images.
When asked, for GUI model for example, use 2048x2048px images. (Use photopea website). Please center the gui in the image is you are using mc gui any 256.

There is a help button, please use it to understand the different concept.

Making a GUI
Making a good GUI is a task that require experimentation :
IMPORTANT :
When reading the following text, consider that by 2048x2048 image I mean a 256x256 image resized using nearest neighbor to 2048x2048.

You must have a base image that have the same shape as the gui you want to make (no worry if there are not slot).
If you want a square gui of 600 by 600 pixels (By 600px i would mean a resized gui times 8 that would make 600 I know mathematically its incorrect, please dont try to make non pixel art gui and read carefully the rest), make sure at the center of 2048x2048 image you have some pixel art of anything like a gui of size 600x600 px on white background. (use photopea website for image editing).
So select the image as base image ([B]).
Remember that it will copy partially the color palette of base image. 
Select a GUI that has the exact same shape, slots disposition, panel position and size, that what you want to achieve, no worry if the gui is looking bad for this one.
Then select it as Shape ([Sh]).

Then you will have to play with the options, You will get bad result, its 100% sure, until you've mastered those settings.
It can make very nice gui with good settings, so you can too !
So the settings to consider for first try are :
Image strength: leave it on 0, if doesnt copy style enough you can put it to 1.
Shape strength: between 5 and 9, the bigger the value, the more you force the ai to make the gui shape and slots disposition ... look like the shape selected image.
Shape affects percent of Generation: put it between 5 and 9 too, 5 means, 50% at the beginning of the generation, it will force the AI to make a generation that has a shape like the shape image, then it will leave space for creativity to improve the image pixel art.

If you put Shape affects percent of Generation and Shape strength at max like 10, you will get a gui like you shape image gui, but colors and textures will be extremely flat, its why in between values for creativity is important !

For Shape Affected By Small/Transparent details, play with this settings if at the end some part of the gui are messed up (bigger value means it takes smaller details of the shape gui image  into account).

Click apply selections.

Click generate image after you have inputted some text into the pormpt textbox.
 
I get a bad image ?
What a suprise !
Change the image base (its what conduct the style and color, please dont use a grey base image if you want a pink gui !)
Play with the settings !
80% of the GUIs are possible with this, please give up fast most of the time, sad..
You must really use different base image, settings etc..
You must understand how the settings work,
Please read Help !!! in style selector GUI pop up

A trick that works well is adding a bit or a lot of noise onto the gui of the base image, it will create great variations without being restrained in pixel colors
If you use complex GUI as base image, make sure to remove small details hard to understand like icons and text and small icons and pixel art in panels 



Of course. Based on the provided source code files, here is the most detailed report possible on all sections of the website, including a complete description of each page and an exhaustive list of every single AI model available.

un gui, c'est assez compliqué parce que il y a beaucoup d'étapes, il y a beaucoup de différents modèles. Moi ce que je recommande hein, euh quand vous voulez faire un gui, c'est d'aller dans la section expert. Puis vous allez dans la section Ultimate dans expert. dessous pixel art, vous allez dans 256px. Et là, vous avez Ultimate MC NGUI. C'est très bon pour faire un gui de base qui ressemble à quelque chose. Autrement, vous pouvez tenter Ultimate Extreme HQ Top MC NGUI euh ou Ultimate Extreme HQ Base MC NGUI qui est plutôt pas mal. Il y a aussi la version alpha, donc Ultimate Extreme MC NGUI Alpha Boosted et la non-boosted, donc alpha tout court, qui fonctionne vraiment bien, surtout pour des images de base. Euh pour des gui qui sont vraiment beaux quand même, franchement, dans la section élite, vous allez dans Elite MC NGUI ou Elite MC NGUI Boosted et la HQ Boosted aussi, elle est plutôt pas mal. C'est plutôt la version 2 ou 3 quand même hein. La 2, c'est plutôt celle que je préfère. Euh, voilà. Sinon dans Orion, la version Orion Pro de gui, elle est extrêmement pas mal, donc à tenter aussi. Par contre, c'est pas dans le 256px, c'est dans la section euh Orion puis gui interface. Et vous allez dans euh Orion Pro Pro H Top Top HQ Gui et cetera, Orion Pro Gui. Là, vous pourrez faire des gui plutôt pas mal.

Absolument. Mes excuses pour la version abrégée précédente. Voici le rapport complet, détaillé et non réduit pour les sections **Ultimate (Extreme)**, **Elite**, et **Orion**, en listant chaque modèle individuellement avec toutes ses propriétés extraites du code source.
