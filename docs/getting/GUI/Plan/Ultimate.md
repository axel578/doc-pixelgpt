### 🧠 Prompt Strategy for Stage 1

For the Foundation stage, your prompt should be **highly detailed and descriptive** with emphasis on materials, lighting, and atmosphere.

**Essential elements to include:**
- **Material specifics:** "polished oak wood grain", "weathered stone texture", "carved detail"
- **Lighting details:** "soft ambient shadows", "gentle rim lighting", "warm glow"
- **Texture richness:** "visible grain patterns", "natural imperfections", "depth relief"
- **Atmospheric depth:** "subtle haze", "depth of field", "layered lighting"

**Example Stage 1 Prompt (117 words):**

```
Inventory GUI in a warm autumn theme, inspired by cozy forest vibes. The interface features wooden textures, golden light, and scattered orange leaves and trees.

Top-left: 4 vertical slots framed by carved wood with small leaf accents.

To his right (Top-left): Preview surrounded by falling leaves.

Below it (bottom-right of section): single off-hand slot.

Top-right: 2x2 crafting grid with one output slot on the right.

Bottom: standard player inventory (9x4 = 36 clear slots), outlined clearly with warm tones.

The background uses dark oak wood and soft sunbeams filtering through trees.

The frame is carved oak, decorated with acorns, vines, and mushrooms.

Lighting is gentle and amber-colored, evoking late autumn afternoon light.

Medieval style.
```

> 💡 **Prompt Length Flexibility:**  
> Elite models handle longer prompts well. Stage 1 can use 150-200 words to establish rich detail foundation.
