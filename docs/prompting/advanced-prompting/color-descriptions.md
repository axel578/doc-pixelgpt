# Color Descriptions

Advanced techniques for specifying colors.

## ðŸŒˆ Color Precision

### Basic Colors

**Primary colors:**
```txt
red, blue, yellow
```

**Secondary colors:**
```txt
green, orange, purple
```

**Neutrals:**
```txt
black, white, gray, brown
```

**These always work well.**

### Descriptive Colors

**More specific:**
```txt
crimson, scarlet, ruby (reds)
azure, cobalt, sapphire (blues)
emerald, jade, forest (greens)
golden, amber, honey (yellows)
violet, amethyst, lavender (purples)
```

**Use when you want specific shade.**

### Color Modifiers

**Adjust color intensity:**
```txt
dark, light, bright, pale, deep, vivid, dull,
neon, pastel, muted, saturated
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Multi-Color Prompts

### Two-Color Items

**Different parts, different colors:**

```txt
"sword with blue blade and golden handle"
"staff with purple orb and silver shaft"
"helmet with red base and white plume"
```

**Clear separation** prevents color bleeding.

### Three+ Color Items

**Complex color schemes:**

```txt
"sword with bright blue blade, golden crossguard, brown leather handle, and red ruby pommel"

"staff with glowing cyan orb, silver metal bands, dark brown wood shaft, and purple magical aura"
```

**Specify which color goes where.**

### Color Gradients

**Transitioning colors:**

```txt
"blade with gradient from light blue at tip to dark blue at base"
"potion with color gradient from red at top to orange at bottom"
"crystal with rainbow gradient across surface"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Color Harmony

### Complementary Colors

**Opposite on color wheel (high contrast):**

```txt
"blue and orange striped pattern"
"red blade with green gem accents"
"purple handle with yellow decorations"
```

**Use for:** Bold, vibrant looks

### Analogous Colors

**Adjacent on wheel (harmonious):**

```txt
"blue and purple magical staff"
"red and orange flame sword"
"green and yellow nature staff"
```

**Use for:** Cohesive, smooth looks

### Monochromatic

**Single color, multiple shades:**

```txt
"sword with light blue blade, medium blue crossguard, and dark blue handle"
"helmet with pale gold trim, golden base, and dark gold shadows"
```

**Use for:** Unified, elegant looks

## ðŸ”§ Color Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Wrong colors in result</summary>

**Solutions:**
1. Be more explicit: "blue" â†’ "bright blue"
2. Specify part: "with blue blade and golden handle"
3. Add modifiers: "bright", "dark", "vivid"
4. Use Style Selector with colored reference image

<details>
<summary>Colors too dull/vibrant</summary>

**Too dull:**
```txt
Add: "bright", "vivid", "saturated", "neon"
```

**Too vibrant:**
```txt
Add: "muted", "pale", "desaturated", "soft"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Colors bleeding between parts</summary>

**Problem:** Blue blade makes handle blue too

**Fix:**
```txt
"sword with blue blade AND golden handle"
(Emphasize separation with AND)

Or:
"sword with BLUE blade, GOLDEN handle"
(Repetition emphasizes distinction)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Color Palette Consistency

### Creating Matching Sets

**Use same color descriptors:**

```txt
Set 1 - Diamond Tools (Blue):
"bright blue diamond sword"
"bright blue diamond pickaxe"
"bright blue diamond axe"
"bright blue diamond shovel"
```

**Consistent color words** = matching results.

### Style Selector for Colors

**Better consistency:**

1. Generate first item with colors
2. Use as Style reference
3. AI copies color palette for next items

**Most reliable method** for matching colors.
