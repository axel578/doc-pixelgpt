## üéØ Matching Existing Styles

### Vanilla Minecraft Matching

**Study vanilla textures first.**

**Key characteristics:**
```
Simple shading (2-3 colors per material)
Clear outlines
Recognizable shapes
Blocky aesthetic
Limited detail
```

**Prompt example:**
```txt
"minecraft style simple diamond sword with blue and white shading and black outline"
```

**Use with:** Standard models (not over-detailed Ultimate models)

### Custom Pack Matching

**To match your existing pack:**

1. Generate first item normally
2. Use as reference in Style Selector
3. Prompt: `"[new item] matching previous style"`

**Example:**
```txt
First: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
Reference: Use this sword image in Style Selector
Next: "blue diamond pickaxe with golden handle"
Result: Matches sword style perfectly
```
