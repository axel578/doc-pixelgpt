# Be Specific

Why specificity is crucial for quality results.

## 🎯 The Specificity Principle

**More specific prompt = Better, more predictable result.**

```
Vague → Random, poor quality
Specific → Targeted, high quality
```

---

## 📊 Specificity Spectrum

### Too Vague

```txt
❌ "item"
❌ "weapon"
❌ "thing"
```

**Result:** AI has no idea what to make. Random output.

### Slightly Better

```txt
⚠️ "sword"
⚠️ "pickaxe"
⚠️ "apple"
```

**Result:** Generic version. Could be any material, any color.

### Good

```txt
✅ "diamond sword"
✅ "iron pickaxe"
✅ "red apple"
```

**Result:** Recognizable, correct item type and material/color.

### Excellent

```txt
✅ "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
✅ "iron pickaxe with wooden handle and leather grip"
✅ "red apple with brown stem and green leaf"
```

**Result:** Detailed, exactly what you wanted.

## 🎯 How to Add Specificity

### Start Simple, Add Details

**Step-by-step approach:**

```txt
Step 1: "sword"
Step 2: "diamond sword"
Step 3: "blue diamond sword"
Step 4: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
Step 5: "enchanted blue diamond sword with ornate golden handle"
```

**Each step adds specificity**, improves quality.

### Answer Key Questions

**Ask yourself:**

```
What is it? → sword
What material? → diamond
What color? → blue
What style? → enchanted/magical
What details? → golden handle, gems
```

**Answer each = complete prompt.**

### Use the 5 W's

```
What? → Item type (sword)
What material? → Material (diamond)
What color? → Colors (blue, golden)
What style? → Aesthetic (enchanted)
What details? → Features (gems, engravings)
```

## 🚫 Avoiding Vagueness

### Vague Terms to Avoid

**Subjective adjectives:**
```txt
❌ "nice" → What does nice look like?
❌ "cool" → Cool how?
❌ "awesome" → Not visual
❌ "good" → Meaningless to AI
❌ "beautiful" → Subjective
❌ "amazing" → Not descriptive
```

**Replace with visual specifics:**
```txt
✅ "ornate" instead of "nice"
✅ "glowing" instead of "cool"
✅ "detailed" instead of "awesome"
✅ "shiny" instead of "beautiful"
```

### Generic Terms to Specify

**Too broad:**
```txt
❌ "weapon" → sword? axe? bow?
❌ "tool" → pickaxe? shovel? hoe?
❌ "food" → apple? bread? meat?
❌ "block" → stone? wood? dirt?
```

**Specific:**
```txt
✅ "sword"
✅ "pickaxe"
✅ "apple"
✅ "stone block"
```

## 🔄 Specificity Iteration

### Progressive Refinement

**Example workflow:**

**Generation 1:**
```txt
Prompt: "sword"
Result: Brown generic sword
Analysis: Need material
```

**Generation 2:**
```txt
Prompt: "diamond sword"
Result: Diamond sword, gray-ish
Analysis: Need color specification
```

**Generation 3:**
```txt
Prompt: "blue diamond sword"
Result: Good, but handle is also blue
Analysis: Need to specify handle separately
```

**Generation 4:**
```txt
Prompt: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
Result: Perfect! ✓
```

**Each iteration adds specificity.**

## 📊 Specificity vs Length

### Finding Sweet Spot

**Too short (vague):**
```txt
"sword" (2 words - too vague)
Quality: 40%
```

**Optimal (specific but concise):**
```txt
"blue diamond sword with golden handle" (7 words)
Quality: 95%
```

**Too long (overwhelming):**
```txt
"incredibly detailed magnificent blue diamond sword with extremely ornate golden handle featuring intricate engravings and beautiful sparkling purple gemstones embedded throughout with magical glowing effects" (26 words)
Quality: 60% (AI ignores half)
```

**Target: 5-15 words**
