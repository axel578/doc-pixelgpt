# Use Adjectives

Descriptive words that improve generation quality.

## üé® Why Adjectives Matter

**Adjectives add specificity and detail.**

```txt
Without: "sword"
With: "blue diamond sword"
Better: "enchanted blue diamond sword"
Best: "enchanted glowing blue diamond sword"
```

**Each adjective** refines the output.

## üé® Adjective Placement

### Natural Order

**Follows English grammar:**

‚úÖ "blue diamond sword" (color ‚Üí material ‚Üí item)
‚úÖ "ornate golden handle" (quality ‚Üí material ‚Üí part)
‚úÖ "glowing red blade" (effect ‚Üí color ‚Üí part)

Awkward but works:
‚ö†Ô∏è "diamond blue sword"
‚ö†Ô∏è "golden ornate handle"
```

**Natural order is clearest.**

### Part-Specific Adjectives

**Specify what adjectives apply to:**

```txt
Clear:
"sword with blue blade and golden handle"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ "blue" applies to blade
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ "golden" applies to handle

Unclear:
"blue golden sword"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Which part is which?
```

**Use "with" to separate** parts and their adjectives.

<details>
<summary>Mistake 1: Too many adjectives</summary>

```

**AI gets confused.** Stick to 3-5 key adjectives.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Mistake 2: Contradictory adjectives</summary>

‚ùå "dark bright blade" (contradictory)
‚ùå "simple ornate handle" (contradictory)
```

**Pick one or the other:**
```txt
‚úÖ "ancient sword" or "new sword"
‚úÖ "dark blade" or "bright blade"
```

</details>

```txt
‚ùå "strong sword" (strength not visual)
