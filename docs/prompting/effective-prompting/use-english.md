## 🧠 Why English Works Best

### Training Data

**AI was trained primarily on English text:**

```
Training data breakdown (approximate):
├── English: 80-90%
├── French/Spanish/German: 5-10%
├── Asian languages: 2-5%
└── Other languages: 1-3%
```

**More English data = better English understanding.**

### Concept Associations

**AI learned strongest connections in English:**

```
English "diamond sword"
└── Thousands of examples in training

French "épée en diamant"
└── Maybe dozens of examples in training
```

**Stronger associations = better results.**

## ❌ What Happens with Non-English

### Common Issues

**Non-English prompts often produce:**
```
❌ Generic/random results
❌ Wrong items entirely
❌ Ignored keywords
❌ Confused interpretations
❌ Poor quality
❌ Inconsistent results
```

### Example Failures

## ✅ Using English Successfully

### If English is Your Native Language

**Just write naturally:**
```txt
✅ "diamond sword with blue blade"
✅ "red apple with stem"
✅ "golden pickaxe with leather grip"
```

### If English is NOT Your Native Language

**Use translation tools:**

**Step 1:** Write in your language
```txt
French: "épée en diamant bleu avec poignée dorée"
```

**Step 2:** Translate to English (Google Translate, DeepL)
```txt
English: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
```

**Step 3:** Simplify if needed
```txt
Simplified: "blue diamond sword golden handle"
```

**Step 4:** Use English version in Pixel GPT

**Recommended translators:**
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) (often better quality)

## 🎯 English Prompting Tips

### Keep It Simple

**Don't overcomplicate:**

```txt
❌ "I would like to have a very beautiful blue diamond sword please"
✅ "blue diamond sword"

❌ "Can you make me a nice red apple?"
✅ "red apple"

❌ "Please generate an iron pickaxe for my Minecraft server"
✅ "iron pickaxe"
```

**Direct descriptions only** - no pleasantries or requests.

### Use Common English Words

**Prefer simple over complex:**

```txt
✅ "blue" over "azure" (unless specific)
✅ "golden" over "aureate"
✅ "shiny" over "lustrous"
```

**Unless the complex word is necessary:**
```txt
✅ "crimson" (specific red shade)
✅ "obsidian" (specific material)
```
