# Not Creative Enough

When results are too plain or boring.

## üòê The Problem

**You wrote:** `diamond sword`  
**AI generated:** Very plain, flat diamond sword with no interesting details

**AI didn't add enough flair.**

[SCREENSHOT: Plain, boring result]

---

## üîç Why This Happens

**High accuracy settings:**
```
Text Accuracy 9-10 = Very literal
Low Creativity = No additions
Conservative model = Simple outputs
```

**AI interpretation:**
```
"diamond sword" ‚Üí Exactly diamond sword, nothing more
AI thinks: "Just the basics, no extras"
Result: Plain, accurate, boring
```

---

## üîß Solutions

### Solution 1: Lower Text Accuracy

**Parameter adjustment:**

```
Current: Text Accuracy 9
Result: Too plain, exact

Change to: Text Accuracy 5-6
Result: More decorative details ‚úì
```

**Lower accuracy = more creative freedom.**

### Solution 2: Add Descriptive Words

**Request details in prompt:**

```txt
Original: "diamond sword"
Result: Plain

Enhanced: "ornate diamond sword with decorations"
Result: Detailed ‚úì

Better: "ornate diamond sword with intricate engravings and gem inlays"

```

### Solution 3: Request Effects

**Add visual effects:**

```txt
"glowing diamond sword"
"sparkling diamond sword with magical aura"
"enchanted diamond sword with blue glow"
```

**Effects add visual interest.**

### Solution 4: Use Creative Models

**Model selection matters:**

```txt
Conservative: "basic", "simple", "vanilla" models
Creative: "creative", "stylized", "extreme" models
```

**Try creative variant** of same resolution.
