# AI Ignores Prompt

What to do when AI doesn't follow your prompt.

## ‚ùå The Problem

**You wrote:** `blue diamond sword with golden handle`  
**AI generated:** Brown generic sword

**AI ignored your prompt completely.**

---

## üîç Common Causes

### Cause 1: Non-English Prompt

**Problem:**
```txt
Prompt: "√©p√©e bleue en diamant"
Result: Generic sword, colors ignored
```

**Why:** AI doesn't understand French well.

**Fix:**
```txt
‚úÖ "blue diamond sword"
```

### Cause 2: Jargon/Unknown Terms

**Problem:**
```txt
Prompt: "netherite sword"
Result: Generic sword, ignores "netherite"
```

**Why:** AI doesn't know "netherite".

**Fix:**
```txt
‚úÖ "dark purple metallic sword with glowing accents"
```

### Cause 3: Too Vague

**Problem:**
```txt
Prompt: "nice sword"
Result: Random sword
```

**Why:** "Nice" is not visual, AI guesses.

**Fix:**
```txt
‚úÖ "ornate diamond sword with decorations"
```

### Cause 4: Model Doesn't Support

**Problem:**
```txt
Using Baby model with complex prompt
Result: Simple output, ignores details
```

**Why:** Baby models have limited understanding.

**Fix:**
```
‚úÖ Upgrade to Standard/Ultimate model
```

## üîß Diagnostic Process

### Step 1: Check Language

**Is prompt in English?**
```
No ‚Üí Translate to English
Yes ‚Üí Continue to Step 2
```

### Step 2: Check Specificity

**Is prompt specific?**
```
"weapon" ‚Üí Too vague, specify: "sword"
"cool sword" ‚Üí Specify: "glowing blue sword"
```

### Step 3: Check for Jargon

**Any game-specific terms?**
```
"elytra" ‚Üí Describe visually: "black wings"
"netherite" ‚Üí Describe: "dark purple metal"
```

### Step 4: Check Model Capability

**Using appropriate model?**
```
Baby model + complex prompt ‚Üí Use Ultimate model
16px model + 32px request ‚Üí Use 32px model
```

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Solution 1: Simplify and Rebuild

**Strip to basics:**

```txt
Original: "magnificent legendary cosmic diamond sword"
Stripped: "diamond sword"
Test: Does this work?

If yes: "blue diamond sword"
Test: Does this work?

If yes: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
Success! ‚úì
```

**Build up from working baseline.**

### Solution 2: Use Different Words

**Rephrase concept:**

```txt
Original: "elytra" (ignored)
Alternative 1: "wings" (may work)
Alternative 2: "dragon wings" (better)
Alternative 3: "black dragon wing membranes" (best)
```

**Try synonyms and descriptions.**

### Solution 3: Increase Text Accuracy

**Force AI to follow prompt:**

```txt
Text Accuracy: 5 ‚Üí 8
```

**Higher accuracy** = more literal interpretation.

### Solution 4: Use Style Selector

**Show AI what you mean:**

```
Upload reference image of desired style
Use in Style Selector
AI copies visual appearance
```

**Bypasses prompt interpretation issues.**
