# Pixel Density & Mixels

Understanding consistent pixel size across your pack.

## üéØ What is Pixel Density?

**Pixel density** = The size of one pixel in the game world

In Minecraft, **one pixel should always be the same size** regardless of whether it's on:
- An item
- A block
- A mob
- A GUI element

## üéÆ Consistent Pixel Density

### Correct (Consistent)

**All 16√ó16:**
```
Sword = 16√ó16
Pickaxe = 16√ó16
Block = 16√ó16
Apple = 16√ó16
```

**Result:** All pixels are the same size in game

### Incorrect (Mixels)

**Mixed resolutions:**
```
Sword = 16√ó16
Pickaxe = 32√ó32 (upscaled to same display size)
Block = 16√ó16
Apple = 64√ó64 (upscaled to same display size)
```

**Result:** Pixels are different sizes = **Mixels**

## ‚ùå What are Mixels?

**Mixels** = Mixed pixel sizes

Occurs when you combine different resolutions in one pack without maintaining scale.

### Visual Example

```
16√ó16 sword next to 32√ó32 pickaxe:

Sword pixels: ‚ñì‚ñì    (larger pixels)
Pickaxe pixels: ‚ñì    (smaller pixels)
```

**Why it's bad:**
```
‚ùå Visually inconsistent
‚ùå Unprofessional appearance
‚ùå Breaks immersion
‚ùå Obvious to experienced players
```

## ‚úÖ Maintaining Consistent Density

### Rule 1: Choose One Resolution

**For entire pack, pick ONE:**
- 16√ó16 (vanilla style)
- 32√ó32 (HD style)
- 64√ó64 (very HD style)

### Rule 2: Stick to It

**All items must be same resolution:**
```
‚úÖ All swords = 16√ó16
‚úÖ All pickaxes = 16√ó16
‚úÖ All blocks = 16√ó16
‚úÖ All food = 16√ó16
```

### Rule 3: Scale Properly

**If you MUST mix resolutions:**
```
Use exact multiples only:
16√ó16 base
32√ó32 = 2√ó scale (acceptable)
64√ó64 = 4√ó scale (acceptable)

Never use:
‚ùå 16√ó16 with 24√ó24
‚ùå 16√ó16 with 48√ó48
‚ùå Random sizes
```

## üéØ Pixel GPT Best Practices

### For Texture Packs

**Step 1: Choose resolution**
```
Vanilla style ‚Üí 16px models
HD style ‚Üí 32px models
Very HD ‚Üí 64px models
```

**Step 2: Use ONLY that model family**
```
‚úÖ Generate all items with same model type
‚ùå Don't mix 16px and 32px generations
```

**Step 3: Verify consistency**
```
Check all exported items are same size:
- All 16√ó16, or
- All 32√ó32, or
- All 64√ó64
```

### For GUIs

GUIs are special case:
```
‚úÖ GUI canvas = 256√ó256
‚úÖ Slots/items inside = can be 16√ó16
‚úÖ This is acceptable (different context)
```

## üîç How to Spot Mixels

### In Minecraft

**Look for:**
- Items with different pixel sizes
- Some items look "sharper" than others
- Some items look "blockier" than others

[SCREENSHOT: Mixel detection example]

### Before Integrating

**Check all your PNG files:**
```
Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Details
Verify: Width √ó Height

All items should be:
‚úÖ All 16√ó16, OR
‚úÖ All 32√ó32, OR
‚úÖ All 64√ó64
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exceptions

### When Mixing is OK

**Different asset types can have different resolutions:**

```
‚úÖ Items = 16√ó16
‚úÖ GUI = 256√ó256 (different context)
‚úÖ Paintings = 16√ó16, 32√ó32, etc. (vanilla does this)
‚úÖ Entity textures = 64√ó64 (different context)
```

**Why?** Different contexts, not displayed together in same scene.

### Vanilla Minecraft Exceptions

Minecraft itself uses different resolutions for:
- Paintings (various sizes)
- Entity models (64√ó64)
- GUI elements (256√ó256)

**But for items/blocks:** Always consistent 16√ó16

## üé® Resolution Strategy

### Planning Your Pack

**Before generating anything:**

1. **Decide resolution:** 16px, 32px, or 64px?
2. **Write it down:** "This pack is 32√ó32"
3. **Use only 32px models** for all generations
4. **Verify each export** is 32√ó32
5. **Never mix** with other resolutions

### Tracking Consistency

Create a checklist:

```markdown
## My Texture Pack - 16√ó16

### Items Generated ‚úì
- [x] Diamond Sword (16√ó16) ‚úì
- [x] Iron Pickaxe (16√ó16) ‚úì
- [x] Golden Apple (16√ó16) ‚úì
- [ ] Ruby Gem (need to generate)

All items verified 16√ó16 ‚úì
```

## üîß Fixing Mixels

### If You Already Have Mixels

**Option 1: Regenerate**
```
‚úÖ Regenerate all items at correct resolution
‚úÖ Most consistent result
```

**Option 2: Upscale (Not Recommended)**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Upscale smaller items to match larger
‚ö†Ô∏è Use "Nearest Neighbor" algorithm
‚ö†Ô∏è Results may look inconsistent
```

**Option 3: Downscale (Not Recommended)**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Downscale larger items to match smaller
‚ö†Ô∏è Lose detail
‚ö†Ô∏è Not ideal
```

**Best solution:** Regenerate everything at target resolution.

## üìä Quick Reference

### Resolution Consistency Rules

```
DO:
‚úÖ Pick one resolution (16, 32, or 64)
‚úÖ Use only models of that resolution
‚úÖ Verify every exported item
‚úÖ Stay consistent

DON'T:
‚ùå Mix 16px and 32px items
‚ùå Use random resolutions
‚ùå Upscale after generation
‚ùå Assume sizes are correct
```

### Pixel Density in Game

```
One 16√ó16 item pixel in game = X units
One 16√ó16 block pixel in game = X units
One 16√ó16 UI pixel in game = X units

All the same size = Good!
Different sizes = Mixels = Bad!
```

## ‚úÖ Self-Check

Test your understanding:

<details>
<summary>What are mixels?</summary>

**Answer:** Mixed pixel sizes - when different textures in a pack have different pixel densities, making some appear sharper/blockier than others.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use 16√ó16 items with a 32√ó32 block?</summary>

**Answer:** No! All items AND blocks should be same resolution (all 16√ó16 or all 32√ó32) to maintain consistent pixel density.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I want to make an HD pack. What should I do?</summary>

**Answer:** Choose 32√ó32 or 64√ó64 resolution, then generate ALL textures using only that resolution model. Never mix with 16√ó16.

</details>

## üéØ Action Items

Before creating your pack:

1. **Decide:** 16√ó16, 32√ó32, or 64√ó64?
2. **Document:** Write down your choice
3. **Commit:** Only use that resolution's models
4. **Verify:** Check every export matches
