## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconceptions

### "I know what an image is"

Many users think they do, but don't understand:
- What transparency actually is
- Why 16√ó16 vs 32√ó32 matters
- How Minecraft displays textures
- What "pixel density" means

**Result:** Poor generations, wrong exports, Minecraft integration issues.

### "Minecraft uses 3D models for items"

**Wrong.** Minecraft uses 2D textures that are **extruded** (stretched on depth axis) to look 3D.

[SCREENSHOT: 2D sword texture ‚Üí 3D appearance in game]

Understanding this affects how you prompt and what you expect.

### "I can use any image size"

**Wrong.** Each model has **specific resolution requirements**:
- 16px models need 16√ó16 images
- 32px models need 32√ó32 images
- GUI models need 256√ó256 images

Using wrong size = broken results.

## üéì Why Learn Fundamentals?

### Better Prompts

Understanding what an image is ‚Üí Write prompts that describe images accurately

### Better Results

Knowing Minecraft texture requirements ‚Üí Generate textures that actually work

### Fewer Errors

Understanding pixel density ‚Üí Avoid mixel issues

### Faster Workflow

Knowing grid math ‚Üí Extract items correctly first time

## üìñ Topics Explained

### Images & Pixels

**What you'll understand:**
- Images are 2D arrays of colored pixels
- Resolution = width √ó height in pixels
- Transparency = alpha channel
- File formats (PNG vs JPEG)

**Why it matters:**
- Choose correct model resolution
- Understand grid extraction math
- Know why transparency matters
- Export files correctly

### Minecraft Textures

**What you'll understand:**
- How Minecraft displays 2D textures as 3D
- Standard resolutions (16√ó16 most common)
- Different texture types (items, blocks, GUIs)
- Resource pack structure

**Why it matters:**
- Generate Minecraft-compatible textures
- Understand what to prompt for
- Integrate textures properly

### Pixel Art

**What you'll understand:**
- Pixel art as an art form
- Color palette principles
- Resolution consistency
- Style characteristics

**Why it matters:**
- Appreciate AI capabilities

## üöÄ Quick vs Deep Learning

### Quick Path (1 hour)

**Read only:**
1. [What is an Image](images-and-pixels/what-is-an-image)
2. [Transparency](images-and-pixels/transparency-and-alpha)
3. [How MC Uses Textures](minecraft-textures/how-minecraft-uses-textures)

Then jump to [Prompting Guide](../prompting/)

### Deep Path (3 hours)

**Read everything in order:**
1. All Images & Pixels articles
2. All Minecraft Textures articles
3. Pixel Art basics
4. Glossary

Then continue to [Understanding AI](../understanding-ai/)

### Reference Path (as needed)

Use Fundamentals as **reference documentation**:
- Check when confused about terms
- Verify resolution requirements
- Confirm format specifications

## ‚úÖ Self-Check Quiz

Test your understanding:

<details>
<summary>Question 1: What is a 16√ó16 image?</summary>

**Answer:** An image that is 16 pixels wide and 16 pixels tall, containing 256 total pixels (16 √ó 16 = 256).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 2: Why does Pixel GPT generate with white background?</summary>

**Answer:** AI generates opaque images. You must remove the background using the Grid Editor's magic wand tool to create transparency for Minecraft.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 3: What is pixel density?</summary>

**Answer:** The size of one pixel in the game world. All Minecraft items should have the same pixel density (usually 16√ó16) to avoid "mixels."

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 4: Why do I need to extract items from a grid?</summary>

**Answer:** AI generates multiple variations at once (2√ó2, 3√ó3 grid). You need to extract individual items as separate 16√ó16 PNG files for Minecraft.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question 5: What's the difference between 16px and 32px models?</summary>

**Answer:** 16px models generate 16√ó16 pixel textures (Minecraft standard). 32px models generate 32√ó32 pixel textures (higher resolution packs).

</details>
