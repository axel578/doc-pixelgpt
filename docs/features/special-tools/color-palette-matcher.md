## üöÄ Step-by-Step Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Reference

**Create or find image with desired colors:**

```
Option A: Use existing generated item with good colors
Option B: Create colored image in Photopea
Option C: Find example image
```

**Requirements:**
```
‚úÖ Clear, distinct colors
‚úÖ Same size as target items
‚úÖ PNG format
```

### Step 2: Prepare Target Items

**Items to recolor:**

```
Generate items normally
Download as PNGs
All same size as reference
```

**Example:**
```
5 iron tools (gray)
Want to recolor to blue
```

### Step 3: Access Tool

**Newbie Premium Tools ‚Üí Color Palette Matcher**

Or **Presets ‚Üí Style Match to Color Palette**

### Step 4: Upload Images

**Upload area has two sections:**

**Reference section:**
```
Upload: Image with desired palette
```

**Target section:**
```
Upload: Items to recolor
```

**All must be same size** (16√ó16, 32√ó32, etc.)

### Step 5: Generate

**Click process/generate button**

**AI:**
```
1. Analyzes reference colors
2. Extracts palette
3. Maps target colors to palette
4. Generates recolored versions
```

### Step 6: Download

**Downloads:**
```
ZIP with recolored items
Same names as originals
Ready to use
```

## üîß Color Matcher Tips

:::tip Same Size Requirement
Reference and target images **must be same size**. 16√ó16 reference with 32√ó32 targets won't work well.
:::

:::tip Clear Reference Colors
Use reference with distinct, clear colors. Avoid gradients or complex shading in reference.
:::

:::tip Transparency Preserved
Transparent areas in targets remain transparent after recoloring.
:::

:::tip Multiple References
Can't use multiple references. One reference palette applied to all targets.
:::

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Not Perfect Matching

```
AI interprets palette, doesn't copy exactly
Some color drift possible
May need manual adjustment
```

### Structural Changes

```
Tool recolors but may slightly alter structure
Usually minimal
Check results carefully
```

### Complexity Limit

```
Very complex color schemes may not transfer well
Simple palettes (3-8 colors) work best
```
