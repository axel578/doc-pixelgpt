## üé® Batch Optimization

### Grouping Strategy

**Organize related items:**

```txt
Batch 1: Diamond Tool Set
diamond sword
diamond pickaxe
diamond axe
diamond shovel
diamond hoe

Batch 2: Iron Tool Set
iron sword
iron pickaxe
iron axe
iron shovel
iron hoe
```

**Benefits:**
- Same model/settings
- Download as complete sets
- Organized results

### Prompt Consistency

**For matching sets, use consistent prompt structure:**

```txt
Good (consistent):
blue diamond sword
blue diamond pickaxe
blue diamond axe

Less consistent:
blue diamond sword with handle
iron pickaxe
golden decorated axe
```

**Consistent prompts = more cohesive results.**
