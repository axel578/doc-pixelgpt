## 📊 Collection Best Practices

:::tip Create Before Generating
Set up collections before you start generating. Select collection during generation for automatic organization.
:::

:::tip Use Descriptive Names
"Diamond Tools 2024" better than "Project 1"
:::

:::tip Star Active Projects
Star collections you're working on. Keeps them at top of list.
:::

:::tip Clean Up Completed
After project done, unstar to archive. Keeps active projects visible.
:::

:::tip Multi-Collection OK
Images can be in multiple collections. "All Weapons" + "Medieval Pack" + "Favorites" all OK for same image.
:::
