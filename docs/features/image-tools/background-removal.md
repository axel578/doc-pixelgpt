## ü™Ñ Magic Wand Tool

### What It Does

**Selects pixels of similar color** for removal.

**How it works:**
```
1. You click a white area
2. Tool selects all similar white pixels
3. Selected area becomes transparent
```

**Threshold controls "similar":**
- Low threshold: Only exact white
- High threshold: White and near-white colors

### Step 3: Set Threshold

**Adjust "Wand Threshold" slider:**

```
Recommended starting value: 5-7
```

**What threshold means:**

```
1-3: Very precise (exact white only)
4-6: Balanced (recommended)
7-10: Permissive (all light colors)
```

### Step 4: Click White Areas

```
First click: Top-left area selected
Second click: Top-right area selected
Third click: Bottom area selected
Keep clicking: All white areas transparent
```

**Selected areas show:**
- Animated border (while selected)
- Checkered pattern (when transparent)

### Step 5: Verify Transparency

**Check entire image:**

```
‚úÖ All white areas should show checkered pattern
‚úÖ Item edges should be clean
‚ùå No white pixels should remain
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Threshold Settings

### Choosing Right Threshold

**Start at 5-7**, adjust based on results:

### Threshold Too Low (1-3)

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå Doesn't select all white
‚ùå White pixels remain
‚ùå Requires many clicks
```

[SCREENSHOT: Incomplete selection]

**Solution:** Raise threshold to 5-6

### Threshold Perfect (5-7)

**Result:**
```
‚úÖ Selects all background white
‚úÖ Doesn't select item pixels
‚úÖ Clean separation
```

**This is the goal.**

### Threshold Too High (8-10)

**Problem:**
```
‚ùå Selects item pixels (light colors)
‚ùå Item edges removed
‚ùå Item damaged
```

**Solution:** Lower threshold to 5-6

## üéØ Advanced Techniques

### Multiple Colors to Remove

**If background isn't pure white:**

```
1. Click color picker
2. Click background color in image
3. Use wand to select
4. Repeat for each background color
```

### Zooming for Precision

**For detailed removal:**

```
1. Scroll wheel to zoom in
2. Click wand on small white areas
3. Get pixel-perfect edges
4. Zoom out to verify
```

**Use for:** Items with complex edges, small details.

### Partial Selection

**Don't need to select everything at once:**

```
1. Click one area
2. Check if selection looks good
3. Click another area
4. Build up selection gradually
```

**Safer for beginners.**

## üîß Troubleshooting Background Removal

<details>
<summary>Magic wand selects item pixels</summary>

**Problem:** Wand selects light parts of item

**Cause:** Threshold too high

**Solution:**
```
1. Lower threshold: 8 ‚Üí 4
2. Undo selection (click selected area again)
3. Re-select background only
4. Avoid clicking near item edges
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>White pixels remain after removal</summary>

**Problem:** Some white pixels not selected

**Cause:** Threshold too low or didn't click everywhere

**Solution:**
```
1. Zoom in to see remaining pixels
2. Raise threshold slightly: 5 ‚Üí 6
3. Click on remaining white areas
4. Or click individual pixels at high zoom
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Background not actually transparent</summary>

**Problem:** Still looks white, no checkered pattern

**Cause:** Not removed yet, only selected

**Check:**
- Did selected areas turn to checkered pattern?
- If no, wand may not be working

**Try:**
- Refresh Grid Editor
- Try different browser
- Adjust threshold and retry

</details>

<details>
<summary>Item edges look rough/jagged</summary>

**Problem:** Anti-aliasing removed or over-removal

**Cause:** Threshold too high removed edge pixels

**Prevention:**
```
1. Use lower threshold (4-5)
2. Don't click too close to item
3. Zoom in for precision
```

**Fix:**
- Regenerate if too damaged
- Or manually fix in image editor
