## 🎨 What is Pixel GPT?

Pixel GPT is powered by the latest advances in AI image generation.  
Simply **type a sentence**, and the AI interprets your text to produce an image that matches your vision.  
You can then refine the result, adjust styles, or regenerate until it’s perfect.

**Example:**

> Prompt: *A silver fox watching the moon in a misty forest, cinematic realistic style*  
> → Result: a captivating, photorealistic image generated in seconds.
