## 📖 Reading Order

| Step | Topic | Why Important |
|------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | [What is AI Generation](what-is-ai-generation) | Understand the basics |
| 2 | [How AI Creates Images](how-ai-creates-images) | Know the process |
| 3 | [What AI Knows](what-ai-knows) | Set expectations |
| 4 | [What AI Doesn't Know](what-ai-doesnt-know) | Avoid frustration |

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### AI is NOT Magic

```
❌ AI cannot read your mind
❌ AI cannot search the internet
❌ AI cannot guarantee perfection
✅ AI is a tool that needs guidance
✅ AI accelerates your creative process
✅ AI works best with clear instructions
```

### AI Has Fixed Knowledge

**AI learned during training** - knowledge frozen in time.

```
✅ Knows: Common Minecraft items, general concepts
❌ Doesn't know: Latest updates, niche mods, your specific ideas
```

### AI Needs Iteration

**Rarely perfect on first try:**
```
Generate → Evaluate → Refine → Regenerate
```

This is normal and expected.

## 💡 Core Understanding

### Text → Image

**How it works (simplified):**
1. You write text description
2. AI "understands" the description
3. AI generates pixels matching description
4. You get an image

[SCREENSHOT: Text to image flow diagram]

### Learning vs Generating

**AI has two phases:**

**Training (past):**
- AI learned from thousands of images
- Built understanding of concepts
- Knowledge is now fixed

**Generation (now):**
- AI uses learned knowledge
- Creates new images
- Cannot learn new things

### Creativity vs Accuracy

**Balance between:**
- **Following prompt exactly** (accuracy)
- **Adding nice details** (creativity)

You control this balance with parameters.

## 🎓 Why This Matters

### Better Prompts

Understanding what AI knows → Write prompts AI understands

### Realistic Expectations

Knowing AI limitations → Don't expect impossible results

### Effective Iteration

Understanding the process → Refine efficiently

## ⚡ Quick Takeaways

1. **AI is a tool** - It doesn't replace skill, it accelerates creation
2. **AI has limits** - Fixed knowledge, can't read minds
3. **Iteration is normal** - Don't expect perfection first try
4. **You guide AI** - Better prompts = better results
5. **AI works best with English** - Language limitation
