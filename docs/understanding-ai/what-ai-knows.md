# What AI Knows

Understanding AI's knowledge base.

## üß† Knowledge Overview

AI learned from **training data** - images and text from the internet.

**Knowledge is:**
```
‚úÖ Broad (many topics)
‚úÖ Fixed (frozen in time)
‚ùå Not complete (has gaps)
‚ùå Not current (no latest info)
```

---

## ‚úÖ What AI Knows Well

### Minecraft (Vanilla)

**Common items:**
```
‚úÖ Diamond sword, pickaxe, axe, shovel, hoe
‚úÖ Iron, gold, stone, wood tools
‚úÖ Food items (apple, bread, steak)
‚úÖ Ores and gems
‚úÖ Basic blocks (stone, dirt, wood)
```

**AI understands these very well** - was trained on vanilla Minecraft textures.

### Common Objects

**General items:**
```
‚úÖ Weapons (sword, axe, bow, dagger)
‚úÖ Tools (hammer, pickaxe, shovel)
‚úÖ Food (apple, bread, meat, potions)
‚úÖ Gems (diamond, ruby, emerald)
‚úÖ Materials (wood, stone, metal, crystal)
```

**AI has good understanding** from general training data.

### Colors & Materials

**Well understood:**
```
Colors: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, etc.
Materials: wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, crystal, glass, etc.
Finishes: shiny, rusty, glowing, ancient, polished, etc.
```

### Artistic Styles

**AI recognizes:**
```
‚úÖ "minecraft style"
‚úÖ "pixel art style"
‚úÖ "cartoon style"
‚úÖ "medieval fantasy"
‚úÖ "futuristic"
‚úÖ "retro 8-bit"
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What AI Knows Partially

### Modded Minecraft

**Popular mods:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è May know: Tinkers' Construct, BuildCraft (if in training)
‚ö†Ô∏è May not know: Obscure/new mods
```

**Success varies** - describe visually instead.

### Game-Specific Items

**Other games:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è May know: Stardew Valley, Terraria (popular)
‚ö†Ô∏è May not know: Niche indie games
```

**Safer:** Describe the item visually, not by game name.

### Recent Additions

**Minecraft updates:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è May not know: Items added after training
‚ö†Ô∏è Example: Very recent 1.20+ items
```

**If AI doesn't understand** - use visual description.

## üìö Knowledge Categories

### Excellent Understanding

**These work great:**

| Category | Examples | Success Rate |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Basic shapes | Sword, circle, square | 95%+ |
| Common colors | Red, blue, green | 95%+ |
| Materials | Wood, metal, stone | 90%+ |
| Vanilla MC | Diamond sword, stone block | 90%+ |

### Good Understanding

**These usually work:**

| Category | Examples | Success Rate |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Fantasy items | Magic staff, spell book | 80%+ |
| Styles | Medieval, futuristic | 75%+ |
| Decorations | Gems, engravings | 70%+ |

### Limited Understanding

**These may fail:**

| Category | Examples | Success Rate |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Mod items | Specific mod names | 40-60% |
| Niche games | Obscure game items | 30-50% |
| Very specific | Exact item from show/book | 20-40% |

## üéØ How AI Learned

### Training Data Sources

**AI was trained on:**
```
‚úÖ Minecraft texture databases
‚úÖ Pixel art galleries
‚úÖ Game asset collections
‚úÖ General image databases
```

**Each image had text labels** - AI learned connections.

### Pattern Recognition

**Example - "Sword" concept:**

```
AI saw thousands of swords in training:
- Different materials (wood, iron, diamond)
- Different styles (medieval, fantasy, futuristic)
- Different colors
- Different sizes

AI learned the pattern: What makes something a "sword"
```

**Now generates new swords** based on that pattern.

## üí° Working with AI Knowledge

### Strategy 1: Use Known Concepts

```txt
‚úÖ "diamond sword" (AI knows this very well)
‚úÖ "golden apple" (AI knows this)
‚úÖ "red potion bottle" (AI knows this)
```

**Higher success rate.**

### Strategy 2: Describe Visually

**For unknown items:**

```txt
Instead of: "elytra" (AI may not know)
Use: "black dragon wings" (visual description)

Instead of: "netherite sword" (may not know)
Use: "dark purple metallic sword" (visual)
```

**Describe what it looks like, not what it's called.**

### Strategy 3: Combine Known Concepts

```txt
AI knows "sword" + AI knows "crystal" + AI knows "glowing"
= "glowing crystal sword" (combines known concepts)
```

**Build from known elements.**

---

## üåç Language Knowledge

### English (Primary)

```
‚úÖ Best understanding
‚úÖ Most training data
‚úÖ Highest success rate (90%+)
```

**Always use English prompts.**

### Other Languages

```
‚ö†Ô∏è French, Spanish, German: 40-60% success
‚ö†Ô∏è Korean, Japanese, Chinese: 30-50% success
‚ùå Rare languages: 10-30% success
```

**AI was trained mostly on English** - other languages significantly worse.

:::danger Critical
**Always use English prompts** regardless of your native language. Translation tools can help.

## üîç Testing AI Knowledge

### How to Know if AI Knows Something

**Try it:**
1. Generate with specific term
2. Check if result matches
3. If not, use visual description instead

**Example:**

```txt
Try: "trident"
Result: May not recognize

Switch to: "three-pronged spear"
Result: Better understanding
```
