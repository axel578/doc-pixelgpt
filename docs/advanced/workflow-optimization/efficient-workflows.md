# Efficient Workflows

Optimize your generation process for speed and quality.

## ‚ö° Speed Optimization

### Workflow: Fast Item Generation

**Goal:** Generate 20 items in 30 minutes

**Process:**

```
1. Use speed models (ultra 16 speed)
2. Simple prompts (3-5 words)
3. Generation Precision: 2 (not 4)
4. Accept good-enough results (don't iterate endlessly)
5. Batch when possible
```

**Output:** 20 items, good quality, fast.

## üéØ Quality-Focused Workflow

### Workflow: Maximum Quality Items

**Goal:** 5 perfect items for showcase

**Process:**

```
1. Use best models (Orion, Elite)
2. Detailed prompts (10-15 words)
3. Generation Precision: 4
4. Enable all quality toggles
5. Iterate until perfect (5-10 tries each)
6. Manual touch-ups if needed
```

**Output:** 5 items, maximum quality.

## üîÑ Batch Integration Workflow

### Workflow: Texture Pack Creation

**Goal:** 50-item pack in 4 hours

**Process:**

**Phase 1: Planning (30 min)**
```
- List all 50 items needed
- Define color scheme
- Choose consistent style
- Write prompts in spreadsheet
```

**Phase 2: Reference Generation (30 min)**
```
- Generate 3-5 reference items manually
- Pick best for style reference
- Upload to My Reference Images
```

**Phase 3: Batch Generation (2 hours)**
```
- Submit batch with 50 prompts
- Use Style Selector with references for consistency
- Wait for completion
```

**Phase 4: Quality Control (45 min)**
```
- Review all 200 generated images (50√ó4 grid)
- Pick best variation of each
- Note which need regeneration
```

**Phase 5: Refinement (45 min)**
```
- Regenerate poor results individually
- Extract all items
- Remove backgrounds
- Download final set
```

**Output:** 50-item cohesive pack, 4 hours total.

## üé® Style Consistency Workflow

### Workflow: Matching Item Set

**Goal:** 20 items, perfectly matching style

**Process:**

```
1. Generate hero item (the best reference)
   - Iterate 5-10 times
   - Pick absolute best
   
2. Upload as Style reference
   
3. Generate remaining 19 items using Style Selector
   - Style Strength: 8
   - Each matches hero item
   
4. Quality check
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Regenerate outliers
   
5. Final polish
   - Manual color correction if 1-2 items slightly off
   - Export set
```

**Output:** 20 items, 95% visual consistency.

## üìÅ Organization Workflow

### Workflow: Multi-Project Management

**System:**

```
Collections structure:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Active Projects
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client A - Fantasy Pack
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Client B - Modern Pack
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Personal - Medieval Pack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Reference Library
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Working References
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Successful Styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Completed Projects
```

**Process:**

**During generation:**
```
1. Select appropriate collection
2. Generate into collection
3. Auto-organized
```

**Weekly cleanup:**
```
1. Move completed to Archive
2. Delete failed generations
3. Update Reference Library
```

**Output:** Clean, organized workspace.

## üîß Iteration Efficiency

### Workflow: Smart Iteration

**Goal:** Find perfect result in minimum iterations

**Process:**

**Iteration 1 (Baseline):**
```
Settings: Balanced defaults
Prompt: Basic ("diamond sword")
Evaluate: What's missing?
```

**Iteration 2 (Targeted Fix):**
```
Change: ONE parameter only (add color to prompt)
Prompt: "blue diamond sword"
Evaluate: Better? What next?
```

**Iteration 3 (Refinement):**
```
Change: ONE more parameter (add detail)
Prompt: "blue diamond sword with golden handle"
Evaluate: Acceptable?
```

**Stop when good enough** (3 iterations vs 10).

**Output:** Quality result, minimal time wasted.

## üí∞ Cost Efficiency (Orion Models)

### Workflow: Orion Quota Management

**Daily limit:** 4-8 Orion generations (Ultimate plan)

**Strategy:**

**Regular items:** Use Ultimate models (unlimited)
```
Swords, pickaxes, blocks ‚Üí ultimate extreme mc item 16 v3
```

**Hero items:** Use Orion (limited quota)
```
Main shop GUI ‚Üí orion pro ultra top hq gui v1
Flagship logo ‚Üí orion badge top hq v1
Promotional renders ‚Üí orion render models
```

**Output:** Best quality where it matters, quota preserved.

## üéØ Multi-Resolution Workflow

### Workflow: HD Pack with Multiple Resolutions

**Goal:** Pack with 16px items, 32px blocks, 256px GUI

**Process:**

```
Week 1: 16px items
- Model: ultimate extreme mc item 16 v3
- Batch 50 items
- Style Selector for consistency

Week 2: 32px blocks
- Model: ultimate extreme mc item 32 v2
- Batch 30 blocks
- Different style reference (higher res)

Week 3: GUI
- Model: ultimate extreme mc any gui v4
- Manual generation with iteration
- Matches pack theme

Week 4: Integration and testing
```

**Output:** Multi-resolution professional pack.
