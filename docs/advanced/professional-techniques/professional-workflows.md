## üì¶ Release-Ready Pack Workflow

### Quality Assurance Process

**Pre-release checklist:**

```
Technical QA:
‚òê All textures same resolution
‚òê All PNG format with transparency
‚òê All files correctly named
‚òê pack.mcmeta correct format
‚òê Folder structure correct
‚òê No missing textures

Visual QA:
‚òê Consistent style across all items

## üé® Consistency Maintenance

### Color Palette Management

**System:**

```
1. Extract palette from reference items
2. Document hex codes:
   - Primary: #00AAFF (blue)
   - Secondary: #FFD700 (gold)
   - Accent: #AA00FF (purple)
   
3. Create palette reference image (Photopea)
4. Use as Base for all generations
5. Verify each item uses palette
```

**Tools:**
```
- Color Palette Matcher preset
- Style Selector Base images
- Manual verification
```

### Style Documentation

**Create style guide:**

```markdown
## Pack Style Guide

### Colors
- Primary: Bright blue (#00AAFF)
- Secondary: Golden (#FFD700)
- Accent: Purple (#AA00FF)

### Materials

## üíº Team Collaboration

### Multi-Person Workflow

**If working with team:**

**Role division:**
```
Person A: Item generation
Person B: Block generation
Person C: GUI creation
Person D: Quality control
Person E: Integration/testing
```

**Shared resources:**
```
- Shared reference library
- Style guide document
- Parameter presets
- Progress tracking spreadsheet
```

**Communication:**
```
- Daily standup (async)
- Shared Collections
- Feedback loops
- Review checkpoints
```

## üìä Production Metrics

### Tracking Efficiency

**Measure:**

```
Items per hour: Target 20-30 with batch
Quality acceptance rate: Target 85%+ first-pass
Iteration average: Target <2 per item
Client revision rounds: Target 1-2
```

**Improve metrics:**
```
- Better prompts (less iteration)
- Better references (higher acceptance)
- Faster decisions (items per hour up)
- Clear communication (fewer revisions)
```
